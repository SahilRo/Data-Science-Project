       "[['Oliver Stone conducted interviews with Vladimir Putin on four separate trips to Russia for a total of nine days between July 2, 2015 and February 10, 2017. The following is a selection of parts of the interviews where Putin talks about Ukraine. * * * July 4, 2015 STONE: Okay, Ukraine. I want to say first of all that I interviewed Mr. Yanukovych here in Moscow a few months ago. And he told me his version of events. PUTIN: The thing is, here is an objective sequence of events. These events can be assessed differently, and you can name these events using different words, different formulas. But it’s quite evident you can follow what was happening day after day. And then you can give the people a chance to make an assessment of their own of what has really happened. STONE: Well, I would like your perspective on it from November to February 20th, 2013 into 2014. During those three months, there was quite a bit of protest in Ukraine. You must have been aware of it. PUTIN: Do you want to know what was happening in Ukraine starting from the early 1990s? What was happening there was the systemic robbery of the Ukrainian people. Right away after independence, Ukraine started an even wilder privatization and robbery of state property, which led to the deterioration of the standard of living—right after Ukraine gained independence. Whatever powers came into force, nothing changed for the lives of ordinary people. And certainly the people were fed up with all those arbitrary actions and that crazy corruption, the impoverishment and the illegal enrichment of other people. That was the root of the discontent the people were feeling. And certainly people were thinking that exiting in any way to the EU would liberate them from the terrible conditions they had found themselves in starting from the beginning of the 1990s. I think that was the driving force behind the developments in Ukraine. And the crisis was sparked, as is well known, when President Yanukovych said he had to postpone the signing of the association agreement with the European Union. That was the starting point. And our partners in Europe and the United States managed to mount this horse of discontent of the people. And instead of trying to find out what was really happening, they decided to support the coup d’état. And now let me tell you how it unfolded and what our position was. Mr. Yanukovych announced that he had to postpone, not cancel, the signing of the association agreement with the European Union because, at that moment, Ukraine had already been a member of the Free Trade Area of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States). Ukraine itself was the engine behind the establishment of the free trade area in the CIS space. And it was the force that led to the creation of this zone. As a result of this, and the fact that the economies of Russia and Ukraine were emerging as a united economy and had unique economic relations, many of our enterprises could not exist independently. There was very deep co-operation between those enterprises. The markets of Russia were absolutely open to imports from Ukraine. We had and still have a zero tariff barrier. We have a single energy system and a single transportation system. There are many other elements which bring our economies together. For 17 years we have been in negotiations with the European Union on the conditions of Russia’s accession to the WTO, and all of a sudden, it was announced to us that Ukraine and the EU were signing an association agreement. And that meant the opening up of the Ukrainian markets. It meant that the technical standards and trade regulation and other elements of the economic policy of the EU were to be implemented in Ukraine, and that was happening very fast without a transition period. At the same time, our customs border with Ukraine was absolutely open. And the EU was able to enter our territory with all of their goods without any negotiations, despite the agreements—principled agreements—which we had reached with them before, during those 17-year talks on our accession to the WTO. Certainly we had to respond to that. And we said that if Ukraine had decided to act like that it was its choice. And we respected that choice. But this didn’t mean that we had to pay for that choice. Why do people living in Russia today have to pay for this choice the Ukrainian leadership has made? That’s why we told them that we would have to take protective measures, and those protected measures were nothing special and they were not discriminatory. We were just trying to extend the regular trade regime to the territory of Ukraine which in international private law is called most favored nation status. So we’re just going to withdraw the preferences. But without preferences, the Ukrainian enterprises would not exist too long in the Russian market. And we proposed that we hold talks with our European partners in a trilateral format. But there was a flat refusal. They told us that we had better stay out of it. They told us, if we are talking to Canada, you would not interfere, right? If you are in talks with China, we are not interfering with those talks—that’s what they told us. And they asked us not to interfere in their relations with Ukraine. And we said, those situations are quite different—Canada, China, and Russia/Ukrainian relations—these are different stories. But we told them, if you think like that then we’re not going to interfere. But in that case, we ask them to respect our right to undertake protective measures and to continue this economic policy. I would go even further, talking about the economics, and after the coup d’état, after the leadership changed in Ukraine, and Mr. Poroshenko arrived in power, at the request of our American partners and the request of the Ukrainian side, we did not implement protective measures. Whereas the Ukrainian leadership signed the association agreement with the European Union. And they ratified this agreement, and after that they postponed that agreement from entering into force until January 1st, 2016. So you’re now shooting this documentary in mid-2015, and as of now, this association agreement between Ukraine and the EU has not yet entered into force. That’s exactly what I had proposed to Mr. Yanukovych. He had proposed that the signing should be postponed. So the question is what was the reason for the coup d’état? Why did they drive this country into chaos, into civil war? So what was the sense behind all that? And now as',\n",
       "  ' to the unfolding of the political situation, indeed you have now mentioned the fact that there were riots and a coup d’état was perpetrated. Let me remind you that before that, on February 21st, 2014, if my memory serves me correctly, three foreign ministers from European countries arrived in Kiev. They took part in the meeting between President Yanukovych and the opposition, and they agreed that early elections were to be held. They agreed on the future of relations between the president and the opposition. And the following day, President Yanukovych went to the second largest city of Ukraine, Kharkov—he went there to participate in a regional conference. And once he departed, his residence was seized, his administration was seized, and the government was seized as well with the use of force. What would you call that? And the Prosecutor General was shot at, one of his security officers was wounded. And the motorcade of President Yanukovych himself was shot at. So it’s nothing more than an armed seizure of power. Naturally, someone supported this coup d’état. Where I started from this—not just personally against Yanukovych, but against the government itself because people were fed up with the chaos of what was happening. The poverty, they were fed up with it, as well as with corruption. After power was seized, some people liked it. But others didn’t like it. People were frightened by this surge of nationalism, radicalism. The first thing the newly-arrived in power started to talk about was the need to adopt a law limiting the use of the Russian language. The Europeans prevented them from doing that. But the signal had already been sent to society, and people understood the direction the country was moving towards in such places as Crimea, where the overwhelming majority of people are Russians by nationality. Whereas Ukrainians who live in those places, as a whole, believe their native language to be the Russian language. Certainly, people in Crimea were especially frightened by this situation. Furthermore there were threats made against them directly. And all that led to the circumstances which are well known. I’ve elaborated on them on many occasions, so if you are interested, I can repeat. But something like that started to happen in the southeastern part of Ukraine on the whole. In the territory which is called Donbass, there are two large cities, and people didn’t accept the coup d’état there either. First there were attempts at arresting them using the police, but the police defected to their side quite quickly. Then the central authorities started to use special forces and in the night people were snatched and taken to prison. And afterwards there was the tragedy in Odessa. And people who were unarmed took to the streets for peaceful protests and they were pushed into a building and were massacred atrociously. Even pregnant women. That is a catastrophe. But still no one is going to investigate it. Certainly not people in Donbass. After that they took up arms. But once hostilities started, instead of engaging in a dialogue with people in the southeast part of Ukraine, after they used Special Forces, they started to use weapons directly—tanks and even military aircraft. There were strikes from the multiple rocket launchers against residential neighborhoods. We repeatedly appealed to the new leadership of Ukraine, asking them to abstain from extreme actions. They started hostilities once, they were put to rout, they stopped, then elections took place, then this new president arrived in power. I talked to him [Poroshenko] on many occasions. I tried to persuade him not to resume hostilities. And he had an opinion of his own about what was happening. He always referred to the losses his forces had sustained to two or three as people during the hostilities with the militia. Certainly that was a tragedy. It is always sad when people die. But when he resumed the hostilities, thousands of people died. And the official forces suffered another defeat. Then they started hostilities for the third time. And once again they were defeated. After that, the latest Minsk Agreements were signed. They agreed that these agreements would be adhered to by both parties. Unfortunately, we’re not witnessing that, and I think the official authorities in Kiev are not willing to engage in any direct dialogue with Donbass. They refuse to be engaged in direct dialogue. Up to now. All the provisions of the Minsk agreements stipulate directly that issues related to amendments to the Constitution, issues related to the adoption of the law, on municipal elections, issues related to this special status of Donbass—all these issues have to be coordinated, that’s what it says. But nothing like that is happening. Right now, the Kiev authorities are trying to make amendments to the Constitution. But according to the information I have—just yesterday I received new information—there is no contact, no negotiations with Donbass. Moreover, the Minsk agreements say directly that the law which had already been adopted by the Verkhovna Rada should enter into force. This is along with the special status of Donbass. Unfortunately, just several days ago President Poroshenko announced that no special status would be granted to Donbass. I have to talk to him. I have to understand what it means. Does it mean that the Kiev authorities refuse to adhere to the Minsk agreements? There are other considerations at work here. One of the provisions of the Minsk agreements says that it’s necessary to adopt a law on amnesty. But the law has not been adopted yet. How can you talk to people in Donbass who are threatened with criminal prosecution? Another provision—the economy and the social sphere of Donbass have to be restored. But instead the authorities are strengthening the blockade of these territories. And all things boiled down to one thing—they are saying that Donbass is fighting against them and that’s why they’re not going to pay them anything. And I say there are pensioners who are entitled, according to the law of Ukraine, to a pension, that there are people with disabilities who are not fighting anyone. They are just victims of this situation—hostages. I asked them, “Do you consider them to be citizens of your country? Well in that case you have to take care of them.” Their response was quite simple—“We do not have money and we’re not going to pay them anything.” We are supplying energy. Ukraine has refused to pay for that ener',\n",
       "  'gy. So on the whole, it’s a full-fledged, very tough blockade. Many people criticize Israel for the blockade of Palestine. I’m not going to elaborate on that, I’m not going to talk about that because it’s a different story entirely. But the same thing is happening here and everyone seems not to notice what is happening. There is not enough food there, not enough medicine. Nothing. And that is a serious issue. We assume that there is no other way to find a solution to this issue, other than adhering to the Minsk agreements—they have to be implemented. We always hear appeals that we have to influence somehow the leadership of these unrecognized republics. Just recently, the leaders of these republics announced publicly that they were willing to go back to the Ukrainian state under certain conditions—if the Minsk agreements were observed. But these agreements were not implemented. And Donbass is not to blame for that. Let me reiterate, I believe that there is no other way to settle this crisis. And the Minsk agreement is the only way toward that end. STONE: Well, obviously there are problems with it. What if the people in Donbass came across the border to Russia? That would be their only hope if things got really bad. PUTIN: Do you mean that the best way to solve this issue is to push these people from their homeland? STONE: I’m not saying that, I’m saying if they have no water, no food, and they can’t go on living, the only way you can travel is on your feet. I mean we’re talking about major migration. PUTIN: Yes, many people have already resorted to these means—two and a half million Ukrainian citizens are in Russia. The overwhelming majority of them are men who are under conscription. They’re eligible for conscription. But in these territories there used to be four and a half million people. Right now estimates are around three million people are left there. STONE: So what if they come? PUTIN: Well, they are already doing that. They are coming. But once the situation quiets down, they go back to their homes. STONE: Yes, I understand. Of course the Kiev government would claim that the Russian army or the Russian government has intervened already in Ukraine with the annexation of Crimea. And the troops—they’re saying there are paratroopers or whatever you want to call them, contractors, soldiers and arms dealers helping them or helping the separatists. PUTIN: As to Crimea, I’d like to ask you, what is democracy? Democracy is a policy which is based on the will of the people. And how do we know the will of the people? In a modern world we use the voting procedure. People came to a referendum and there were no whips, no machine guns. And you cannot use these means to make a person come to a polling station to vote. People came, the turnout was more than 90 percent. And more than 90 percent voted in favor of re-unifying with Russia. The choice of the people has to be respected. And you cannot try to conform international law to your political interests against the principles of democracy. STONE: Nonetheless, the United States would say that you have violated international law—and that’s been a theme that has been repeated again and again by the EU. And you yourself acknowledged that the US had done that in Iraq, so it’s a question of course, at the end of the day, of power, isn’t it? PUTIN: Yes, that’s correct. As to armed forces of the United States coming to Iraq. And there were no elections there. No elections were held. As to Crimea, yes, we created conditions for people to be able to come to polling stations. But we were not engaged in any hostilities there, no one was shooting there, no one was killed. STONE: But literally the US would argue that elections were held eventually in Iraq. PUTIN: In the end, yes, but before that there was a war. And there was no war in Crimea. That’s the first thing. Secondly, there is another criticism addressed to Russia. They are saying that international law was violated. I have already talked about that but I’d like to emphasize that in the course of the Kosovo crisis, the International Court of Justice considered very cautiously this situation and the ICJ arrived at a conclusion saying that when the issue of self-determination of a nation is concerned, in accordance with Point Two of the United Nations charter, if my memory serves me correctly, the concerns of the central authorities of this or that country on this matter are not required. And thirdly, since you are preparing this documentary and you have time, I’d like to ask you to do something—have a look at what was said on that matter by the representatives of the United States, and the representatives of certain European countries—Germany, Great Britain—what they said in those matters when they were talking about them with the ICJ. All of them were saying that no consent from Belgrade was needed, and they were saying that everything was done in accordance with the United Nations Charter. I was always wondering if Kosovars were allowed to do it, why is that not allowed to Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, and Crimeans? There is no difference whatsoever. Moreover, the decision on the independence of Kosovo was adopted by the decision of the parliament. Whereas, in Crimea first the parliament voted in favor of independence, and afterwards they held a referendum and during that referendum the people said that they were willing to go back to Russia. Every step has a reason behind it. STONE: Was there any UN condemnation of the annexation of Crimea? PUTIN: No, I don’t know anything of that. STONE: Can we talk a little bit about the airplane that was shot down in July—the Malaysian Airliner [MH17]? PUTIN: Yes, certainly. STONE: Thank you. I’ve heard both sides. I know Russian intelligence has claimed there were two planes in the air, or at least two planes, and there was a possible shooting down of the airplane from another aircraft. Is that correct? PUTIN: There are two principal versions. The first version is that this plane was shot down by the Buk air defense system of the Ukrainian armed forces. And the second version is that the same system, the same system of arms—the Buk systems that are produced in Russia—was employed by the militia, the separatists. Primarily, let me say that in any case it’s a terrible catastrophe. And that is simply atrocious. And in this regard, let me say something. That would not have happened if the leadership of Ukraine had listened to us and had not started full-fl',\n",
       "  'edged hostilities. It was the Ukrainian authorities who started to use all kinds of weapons systems in Donbass. Now as to the aircraft, the planes which were in the air—as far as I know, right away after this terrible catastrophe, one of the Ukrainian air controllers, I think he was a specialist originating from Spain, announced that he had seen a military aircraft in the corridor assigned for civil aircraft. And there could have been no other military aircraft than the one controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. Certainly that needs to be investigated. I’m not saying that this plane was shot down. I do not say that this military aircraft shot down the civil aircraft, but the question is what was that plane doing in the corridor because that is against the existing rules of the international flights of civil air aviation. As for the Buk air defense systems, which can send missiles from Earth—according to our specialists and experts, and not just our intelligence services but also our ballistic experts—the reports that I’ve received say that the strike hit the tail of the aircraft. And if that is the case, then that is exactly where the air defense system of the Ukrainian armed forces were stationed. So I don’t understand what they were doing there in the first place. Why were they there and why were they pulled out of there so quickly? In any case, that requires a thorough and de-politicized investigation. STONE: Do you believe the American intelligence has any information about this, because wouldn’t they be watching this situation after the coup? Wouldn’t they have intelligence from satellites and whatever? PUTIN: I’m confident that that is exactly the case. But regrettably, there is no proof from the partners that we’ve received. STONE: But they have not shown much? PUTIN: No, that’s quite understandable, because we understand their position on Ukraine. And certainly they all wanted to shift the blame on the militia fighters in Donbass and indirectly Russia, who supports the militia. STONE: So if they had contrary information they don’t want to release it? PUTIN: Yes, if this information is contrary then they will never reveal it. STONE: Can we talk about outside influences in this Ukraine story now? PUTIN: Yes, certainly. STONE: We know about the NGOs that were operating in Ukraine. We know that Victoria Nuland, the Undersecretary of State for Eastern Europe I believe, was very active supporting a change in government. We know that Senator John McCain visited and was seen at rallies with extremist leaders, including some neo-Nazis. We know that America and the National Endowment for Democracy, which is also a very influential private nonprofit NGO was very active, very active here. Paul Gershman, who was the president of it made very strong independent speeches—he wanted an independent Ukraine. And we know that the Hungarian billionaire hedge funder George Soros was also very involved in supporting the groups in Ukraine. PUTIN: Yes, all that is true. You know I do not always understand the rationale behind the actions of our partners. I already said that sometimes I fall under the impression that they’ve got to control or enforce some discipline in their Euro-Atlantic camp. And to that end they need some external enemy. And despite all the concerns they have, Iran at this point cannot fulfill this need. STONE: In other words, the United States can keep a united pro-American Europe and NATO with an external enemy such as Russia. PUTIN: I can say something definitely—that is true. I know that, I feel that. Without this internal discipline, the Euro-Atlantic cause is destabilized. This is not the Cold War we’re living in. Several years ago, certain leaders told me that our American friends were asking me to frighten them. But they said that they were not afraid. They understood that the world had changed. And that external threat—it is impossible to enforce this strict discipline. And in that regard, that is probably in the interests of someone, but I think that is the wrong logic. Because this logic is looking back into the past. But you have to look into the future. You have to understand that the world is different now. There are new threats arising, strategic threats included. You cannot freeze it as if we were still living through the Cold War. I told you about the ABM system, about the ABM treaty, about the fight against terrorism. Regrettably, I have to say that all our attempts at fostering a relationship with the United States were met either with the lack of understanding or total indifference. But this situation cannot persist. STONE: I’m surprised. I’ve always had great respect for Russian intelligence services and their knowledge of the West, but in this situation I was surprised by their lack of, it seems, information of what was going on in Ukraine. It’s been said that you yourself were surprised by this takeover, and that you were paying attention to the Sochi Olympics and you weren’t paying attention to what was going on in Ukraine. What happened to your intelligence service? PUTIN: No, that is not true. I had a fairly good picture of what was happening within Ukrainian society. And there is no doubt about that. This take-over could have happened at any time. There was a takeover when Kuchma was leaving office. STONE: And a pro-Western group came in, is that what you’re saying? PUTIN: Yes, and Yanukovych was the one to win the elections. But the street did not agree with that outcome of the election, and a third round of elections was proclaimed in violation of the Constitution. So it was also a quasi-coup d’état. Back then I thought they had made a grave mistake. Even though pro-Western politicians arrived in power, people very soon lost their confidence in those leaders as well. Because those politicians continue to do everything that had been done before them by the previous leaders of the country. And that’s why they were defeated in the subsequent elections. Unfortunately, President Yanukovych didn’t manage to change much in the country either. And the same thing happened to him. The very paradigm has to be changed of their relation to the people. They were talking about the need to get rid of the oligarchs. And now the oligarchs are in power. So nothing has changed really. They were talking about the need to get rid of corruption. What has changed? Nothing. The governor of the Odessa region is now former President [of Georgia] Saakashvili. STONE: Yeah, I k',\n",
       "  'now. PUTIN: That’s just a spit in the face, an insult to the people of Odessa and to the whole of the Ukrainian people. I do not want to give any assessments of Saakashvili, I think that would be the wrong thing to do. Whatever person he is, he was president of a nation [Georgia]. And it is up to the Georgian people to give him assessments. And besides, we are personally acquainted with him. He was not even granted a working visa in the United States. The investors he tried to get did not want to give him a permanent job. But quite strangely, he can act as the governor of the Odessa region [in Ukraine]. Are there no people with integrity, people from Ukraine who can do this job quite as well? It’s just ridiculous. And it’s an insult to the Ukrainian people. STONE: I have three specific questions about Ukraine, then perhaps we can take a walk? During the Maidan massacre, did you get any intelligence of what was going on? It’s the strangest massacre. Because of the number of casualties of policemen, and the civilians who were killed, and the policemen not firing back, they were retreating and called back by Yanukovych. And during that it seems like there was a sniper force that was definitely aiming at the policemen and civilians to create the chaos necessary for the takeover. PUTIN: To start with, that is absolutely correct. Yanukovych didn’t give an order to use weapons against civilians. And incidentally, our western partners, including the United States, asked us to influence him so that he did not give any orders to those weapons. And President Yanukovych said that he couldn’t imagine any other way of dealing with this situation. He couldn’t sign an order on the use of weapons. And when both the police and the protesters were shot at, it’s correct what you’ve said—the goal was to sow chaos. And certainly President Yanukovych was not interested in the expansion of this chaos. He was interested in containing the situation. But I have to say that the so-called protesters were very aggressive. STONE: Some of them, yes. PUTIN: Some of them centered in the office of the party of regents which was headed by President Yanukovych. And they burned it down. And technical workers came out and they said we are not members of the party. There was one electrician. And he was shot and they were thrown into the basement and then everything was burned. And that was even before the takeover. So Yanukovych was not interested in chaos, he did everything he could in order to quiet the situation, to restore calm. STONE: Well, who are these snipers? PUTIN: Well, who could have placed these snipers? Interested parties, parties who wanted to escalate the situation. I do not have any data on who precisely those snipers were, but elementary logic tells me. STONE: Have you heard any reports about the training that was going on in other cities, in Minsk and so forth, of battalions and the Right Sector—hardened people of the right? There were 100-man units that came to the city, I am told, in the days before the Maidan massacre. PUTIN: No, not in Minsk, but we have information available to us that armed groups were trained in the western parts of Ukraine itself, in Poland, and in a number of other places. STONE: I see. Have you heard of the Azov battalion? PUTIN: Yes, certainly. There are certain armed formations which are not accountable to anyone, nor are they accountable to the central authorities in Kiev. I believe that is one of the reasons why the current leadership right now cannot put an end to these hostilities. That is simply because they are frightened that these uncontrollable armed forces will return to the capital. STONE: My second question—Mr. Obama, during this period, what kind of communications did you have with him? PUTIN: We were in constant contact. Well, I can say it was almost on a permanent basis. And Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov, they had personal meetings months ago and they also had telephone conversations. And myself and the president of the United States, we both had a great deal of regular telephone conversations. STONE: Obviously you didn’t agree. PUTIN: Yes, we had different assessments as to the causes of the Ukrainian crisis and its unfolding. STONE: Are you still talking to him? PUTIN: Yes, just a couple of days ago I had a telephone conversation with him. We talked about our bilateral relations, the Middle East situation, and also the Ukrainian situation. But I have to tell you—I think that there is some understanding on a number of issues—despite the differences in our assessments. There is some common understanding. STONE: Would you say relations or the dialogue is cordial? PUTIN: No, but they are businesslike. And quite even. STONE: Do you see each other visually when you talk? PUTIN: No, but I can tell you that this dialogue is a dialogue of interested parties. So there is no confrontation behind it. I think that President Obama is a thinking person, he assesses the real situation, with some things he agrees, with others he disagrees. But we also manage to find points of common understanding on a number of complicated issues. And this is a fruitful dialogue. STONE: This is a just a trivial question, but I’ve always been curious, do you call each other Vladimir and Barack? PUTIN: Yes. STONE: You call him Barack or Barry? PUTIN: Barack. STONE: You do—first name, that’s great. Last question—Sebastopol and the meaning of it. It was your major submarine base, I believe, on the Black Sea. And it has obviously been a major defense facility. And you had an agreement with Crimea to have troops there—it was a base that was agreed to. I don’t know exactly when the treaty was made. How, when this was going down, obviously this is important in your mind—if the United States or NATO troops are able to take over this base, what are the consequences of that? PUTIN: I was thinking that this never was supposed to happen. Well, there is the subjunctive mood as we say, but there can be no subjunctive mood in politics—the “what if.” STONE: Hypothetical. PUTIN: And this treaty with Ukraine was supposed to be enforced until 2019. And after that it was supposed to be prolonged even further, I don’t remember—another 20 years probably. But in response to that we reduced the price of Russian natural gas for Ukraine. We gave them a large discount. And I’d like to draw attention to the fact that even though Crimea is right now part of the Russian Federation, this gas discount for Ukraine has not been ',\n",
       "  'withdrawn. STONE: Right. The consequences of a US seizure of the base or a NATO base? PUTIN: Those consequences would have been very grave, because, well this base per-se doesn’t mean anything—no significance, but if they had tried to station either ABM systems or offensive systems in those territories, that would no doubt have aggravated this situation in the whole of Europe. Incidentally, that is what is happening in Eastern European countries. I already talked about that. I just wanted to tell you about one nuance—why we are responding so acutely to the expansion of NATO? Well, as a matter of fact, we understand the value—or lack thereof—and the threat of this organization. I know this organization is a loose one and it’s not viable, even despite Article 5 of the treaty. What we’re concerned about is the practice of how decisions are made there. I know how decisions are made there. And the experience of previous years of work has given me full information as to how decisions are made. When a country becomes a member of NATO, bilateral talks are held on this country and it’s quite easy to deal with this country on a bilateral basis, including on the placement of weapons systems that are threatening to our security. Once a country becomes a member of NATO, it is hard to resist the pressure of such a large presence as the United States, and any weapons system can be stationed in this country all of a sudden. An ABM system, new military bases, and if need be, new offensive systems. And what are we supposed to do in that case? In this case we have to take countermeasures, and that means that we have to aim our missile systems at facilities which, in our view, are becoming a threat to us. And the situation becomes more tense. And who needs that, and why? STONE: You said that the base in Crimea didn’t mean anything in itself. Does that mean to say that you would have built another naval base on the Black Sea elsewhere? PUTIN: We already built such a military base. STONE: Oh, where’s that? PUTIN: In the city of Novorossiysk. And it’s more modern, more sophisticated than the last one. STONE: Interesting. What province or region? PUTIN: It’s the Krasnodar region between Sochi and the Crimea. STONE: I see, good to know. PUTIN: So it’s also the Black Sea coast. Right. Thank you very much. * * * May 9, 2016 STONE: Quick updates on Syria and Ukraine—I’m talking about security on the borders of Russia. I was very impressed with the classical music symphony in Palmyra, but can you give me a quick update on Syria as it concerns Russian security and Ukraine? PUTIN: As far as Ukraine is concerned, I think you know what is going on. They have this crisis which, in a slackened form, is still going on. I think that the most important component of the Minsk Agreement is the political settlement, but regrettably it is up to the Kiev authorities to implement this part of the agreement, and so far they are not doing that. They should have amended the Constitution in accordance with the Minsk Agreement, and that should have been done before the end of 2015. But they didn’t do that. They were supposed to pass a bill, a law on amnesty. This law was adopted by the parliament, but it was not signed by the president, nor has it entered into force yet. There is another law that should be adopted and that should enter into force—that is the law on the special status of these unrecognized republics. The current Ukrainian leadership says the following: they say that since, at the line of conflict, there are still clashes, there is still violence, then they say the conditions are not yet in place to implement this political settlement. But in my view, this is only a hollow pretext because you can easily create a clash somewhere at the line of contact and then this is going to go on ad infinitum. The most important thing right now is to achieve a political settlement. Then there is a second course which explains why this is being done according to the Ukrainian counterparts. The Ukrainian leadership insisting that the Russian-Ukrainian border where the unrecognized republics are located, should be closed. And indeed the Minsk Agreements presuppose the closing of the Russian border by the Ukrainian frontier offices, but only after the key political decisions have been taken. But until these political decisions have been taken and implemented, until people are safe in those unrecognized republics, the closing of the border will only mean one thing—that they are going to be encircled and later eliminated. We talked about that during the long night when we hammered out the Minsk agreements. We talked about that in great detail. And our Ukrainian counterparts first agreed to that, but right now they seem as if they do not understand what is going on. Right now we support a proposal set forth by President Poroshenko to reinforce the observer contingent on the line of contact. He is the one who initiated this proposal and I have supported it. Moreover, he suggested that the OSC observers should be equipped with arms and we support that as well. The problem is further aggravated by the fact that the economic and internal political situation in Ukraine has deteriorated dramatically. And right now, some of our partners—I’m not going to name them—are saying that the Ukrainian president is not capable of making these political decisions due to the difficult internal political situation in Ukraine. And a year ago, I suggested that President Poroshenko should hold early elections and thereby reinforce his position, so that, even though we had differences, he would be able to push through all the required political decisions. But back then, our American friends, our European friends told us that the prime minister—back then it was Mr. Yatsenyuk and President Poroshenko had to pull their efforts together, they had to work together and we know how it ended—by a split up in the government and a very difficult political situation. And right now when I remind our partners of that, they simply shrug their shoulders. The question is, how does Russia fit into all this. And the United States and Europe keep coming up with new accusations, trying to accuse Russia of something new because they cannot publicly admit that they’ve made mistakes. That’s why they choose to blame Russia. We have quite a famous poet who wrote fables—his name was Krylov—and one of these fables features a dialogue between a wolf and a lamb. In this dialogue with the',\n",
       "  ' wolf, the lamb is trying to justify himself, saying that he is not to blame for anything. And once the wolf has run out of arguments, he decides to put an end to this discussion. And he says, “Dear lamb, you are only to blame because I am hungry.” [laughter] STONE: If this happens—you used the word “eliminated” I believe—what’s the worst-case? I mean, how many Russian-Ukrainians would be at risk? PUTIN: It’s not about the leadership of those unrecognized republics. You see, it’s that everyone who lives in those unrecognized republics—there are about three million citizens there—they participated in the election campaign, they took to the polls, and that’s why—in the absence of a law on amnesty—they can all be persecuted as separatists. STONE: Three million people at the great risk. So it could turn into another situation like in Serbia, Bosnia? PUTIN: Certainly, that’s what it looks like. We remember the tragedy of what took place in Odessa. More than 40 people—innocent, unarmed—were encircled and burned to death. And those who tried to get away were beaten to death with iron rods. And who was responsible? People adhering to extreme, radical views and such people can enter the territory of these republics and do the same thing there. When I talk about this issue with some of my Western partners, when I’m telling them that mass infringements of human rights can be transpiring there, do you know what they tell me? They tell me that these people have to go to human rights organizations to seek protection. They have to ask for help—different international organizations. Think of what took place at the trade union building in Odessa and ask yourself who is going to apply to an international organization after the massacre that took place there? STONE: I can’t imagine Russia standing by and watching that happen. PUTIN: Not in the least—certainly not. We are going to help, but we cannot do so unilaterally. Because the key decisions are to be taken by the Kiev authorities. * * * May 11, 2016 STONE: Okay, I’d like to skip forward from 2008 into the Ukraine crisis. We’ve had this discussion before on my first visit, on the terrace, and I’ve listened to it and realized there are things I didn’t ask. And I want to go over it, just to be really clear, because this will be very important to the people who will be watching the documentary or reading this transcript. PUTIN: Certainly. Indeed, it requires a great deal of effort to clarify all that. Because your colleagues, your Western journalists are very talented people. They are capable of convincing people that black is white and vice versa. Just as an example—the tragic events, the assault against South Ossetia—Mr. Saakashvili publicly announced that he ordered his troops to commence that action. One of his dignitaries even spoke on television saying the same thing. I didn’t believe it when I heard it, when the media was accusing Russia of this attack. And millions of TV viewers believed that all across the world. This is just astounding, this capacity that your American and European journalists can have. You’re all very talented. But when our journalists try to protect Russian national interests, when they take a stance, they are declared immediately the mouthpiece of Kremlin propaganda—much to my chagrin. STONE: It’s a double standard. I would love to see a debate—a meeting between Mr. Saakashvili and you—it would be great to see the two of you in a room. PUTIN: We met on many occasions. STONE: Are you convinced he’s still mad? PUTIN: I have never said that. STONE: I thought you said he was mad? PUTIN: No, I was told by my Western counterparts that he was mad. And I could never afford to say anything like that to my counterpart, either the incumbent or the previous ones. STONE: When’s the last time you saw him? PUTIN: I do not remember. Certainly before the crisis in South Ossetia. STONE: Not after the war, though? PUTIN: No, but on many occasions I said to him, “Mikheil Nikolaevich, please do everything to prevent bloodshed. If you want to restore relations with these parts of Georgia, you have to be very cautious.” These fictions, these divergences, they had a reason a long time ago—not hundreds of years of ago—but back in 1919 when the Russian empire was splitting up. Those parts of Georgia, which incidentally had been part of the Russian Empire as independent states before Georgia became part of the Russian empire. Back then, those parts declared that they were ready, that they wanted to still be part of Russia. And back then very harsh actions, military measures were employed against them. Local populations still view those actions as genocide and mass elimination of people. In order to surmount all these difficulties, patience was required, as well as certain diplomatic art. STONE: Yeah, I understand. PUTIN: And that was lacking apparently. That’s what the Georgian leadership back then was lacking. Moreover, the current Georgian leadership believe that this action Saakashvili performed was a terrible crime against the Georgian people in the first place, because it has led to very grave consequences. STONE: I was shocked when Shevardnadze—hard name to pronounce—I was shocked because I really respected him as a foreign minister with Gorbachev. You may not agree, but I was shocked when he wanted to join NATO and he became corrupt, I heard. He was a very respected figure in the 1980s. PUTIN: Well, everything passes, everything changes. STONE: That’s true. But just quickly—Obama’s in office now, take it from 2008 to the Ukraine crisis and how this … nothing really major, dramatic happened, as I remember, except for the Snowden affair in 2013. He was offered asylum here in Russia and that upset America. But was there anything else in that period that you remember, between you and the US that was exacerbated, was argued about? PUTIN: Well, how can you say that nothing major happened? When President Kuchma’s term came to an end—I do not remember exactly the year—presidential elections took place in Ukraine. And Mr. Yanukovych won that presidential election, but the opposition didn’t like that. And mass riots erupted. These riots were fueled quiet actively by the United States. And a third round of elections was announced—in violation of the country’s constitution. Per se, this can be perceived as a coup d’état. And pro-Western politicians arrived in power after that—Mr. Yushchenko and Timoshenko. I cannot say that I welcomed this way of chan',\n",
       "  'ging the government. Nowhere is that proper, but in the post-Soviet space, especially, constitutions cannot be broken. Luckily no bloodshed took place there. STONE: Did you have a phone call with Obama about this issue? PUTIN: That was before Obama came to office, and yet we maintained cooperation with the Ukrainian leadership of Mr. Yushchenko and Timoshenko. I went to Kiev, they came back to Moscow. We met in third party countries. And we implemented all our plans of cooperation, but their policy, it was not well-liked by the Ukrainian people. That is why after the presidential term of President Yushchenko ended, Mr. Yanukovych won the election once again and everyone acknowledged that. It was recognized by everyone. But apparently this was not the best form of government either. Economic difficulties, together with social difficulties, to a great extent had undermined the trust in the new leadership as well. What needed to be done in order to rectify the situation? They should have organized another election. And they should have chosen people with different economic and social views. These people should have made another attempt at arriving back in power. But certainly they should have prevented any escalation to bloodshed, and what’s absolutely certain is that no one should have supported these bloody events. STONE: But you’re talking about 2014—you’re jumping ahead. PUTIN: Yes, in 2014. STONE: But between ’08 and ’14, there was this one election you’re talking about which is in 2012, I think? PUTIN: I do not remember. STONE: There were so many, I mean, the Ukraine to us—we were not paying attention. VP; Yes, well you personally might not have been paying attention, but the CIA was paying a great deal of attention. STONE: I know. It was very confusing. There was a guy with a poisoned face earlier in the century. PUTIN: Yes, you’re talking about Yushchenko—he said that he’d been poisoned during the election campaign. And yet he was elected to office. And he worked and I met with him on many occasions. Why did they need to resort to violence? That’s something I cannot quite understand. Moreover, I talked about that repeatedly and the 2014 President Yanukovych was in office and he signed an agreement with the opposition. He agreed to all the requirements that they had set forth. STONE: In the crisis, in the final days? PUTIN: Yes and he even agreed to hold early elections. So why do they need to perform this coup d’état? I do not understand. STONE: Okay. So we all remember, I remember you vividly on television saying—I think it was with Charlie Rose, I forgot—but you said there was much evidence and you smiled as you said it. There was much evidence—implying that a thousand eyes were upon this. You know that expression, a thousand eyes were upon this coup. It was a coup in slow motion. It was pretty evident, transparent to the Russians. PUTIN: Certainly. STONE: And you said that on television, but I think the American people find it difficult to understand but, by talking about the evidence and showing it, we might be able to convince the American public that they were being fooled by the Western narrative of events and that there indeed was a coup d’état that went down. PUTIN: That’s very easy to achieve—you simply have to look at the developments. After Yanukovych announced that he had to postpone the signing of the association agreement with the European Union, no one listened to the reasons why, to the terms, to the timetables—mass riots erupted right away after the announcement. These riots led to the seizure of his residence, and on the eve of that, he had signed an agreement with the opposition on settling the situation, on the possible organization of early elections, and three foreign ministers of European countries added their signatures to the agreement. Where are these guarantees? Once the president went to the second largest city of the country to attended a political event, armed men seized the residence of the president. Imagine something like that in the US, if the White House was seized—what would it be called? A coup d’état, or would you say that they have come to sweep the floors. The prosecutor general was shot at. There were so many shootings, so much violence. STONE: I had an interview with Mr. Yanukovych, so I know his version, but it was characterized in the US press as if Yanukovych abandoned Kiev, because he felt the crowd would tear him apart. PUTIN: Yes, that’s the version used to justify the support granted to the coup d’état. Mr. Yanukovych didn’t leave to go abroad. He was in the country when his residence was taken. Moreover, one day afterwards, he used our support and he relocated to the Crimea. Back then, the Crimea was still part of Ukraine. And Yanukovych stayed there for more than 10 days—at least a week in the Crimea, thinking there was still a chance that those people who had put their signatures under the agreement with the opposition would make some attempt, with a view to settling this conflict by civilized, democratic, legal means. But it never happened. It became evident that if he was taken by these people he would simply be killed by them. And, afterwards, he found himself in Russia. Everything can be perverted or distorted, millions of people can be deceived if you have a monopoly on the media. But in the end, I believe for an objective and impartial spectator it’s clear what happened. A coup d’état had taken place. All right, if this coup d’état had made some positive changes … but, on the contrary, the situation deteriorated even further. Ukraine lost territory, not due to Russia’s actions, but due to the choice made by those who are live in Crimea. These people didn’t want to live under the banner of nationalists. A civil war erupted in the southeastern part of Ukraine, in the Donbass. After that, the country witnessed a terrible drop in the GDP. The largest industrial enterprises shut down. Unemployment soared. The real income of the population, their salaries, plunged, inflation hit 45 or 47 percent. And no one knew how to address these issues, or that this would be further exacerbated by an internal political crisis, by a fight between the Prime Minister and the President. In the end, it led to Prime Minister Yatsenyuk resigning. He had actively supported, and had been supported by, the American administration throughout the crises. And what happened next? The European Union opened its borders to Ukraine. It zeroed out the tar',\n",
       "  'iff for Ukrainian goods. But Ukraine’s trade with the European Union decreased by 23 percent, and with Russia it decreased by 50 percent. Ukrainian industrial output is not in high demand in European markets and now they have no access to the Russian market. The agricultural produce that used to be traded successfully in Western Europe is restricted by quotas. And these quotas were introduced by the Europeans. They were exhausted during the first two months after the signing of the agreement. Right now Ukraine is fighting to get a visa-free arrangement for its citizens. Do you know why they are doing that? So they could ensure free exit from the country to find new jobs outside of the country. But the people are once again being tricked, because even if a visa-free deal were granted to Ukraine, that would not enable them to work abroad. STONE: Visa-free to Russia? PUTIN: No, visa-free to the European Union. People heard that they would be able to relocate and work in another country in Europe. There’s something I’d like to tell you. Ukraine has always been an industrialized country as part of the Soviet Union. And right now, a Ukrainian’s dream is to work as a nurse or a gardener or a nanny in a European country amid the complete de-industrialization of the country. Why did they need all that? I simply cannot imagine. STONE: Well, it seems to me what you’re saying is that Russia doesn’t need Ukraine. PUTIN: Russia is a self-sufficient country. We do not need anyone, but with Ukraine we are connected by thousands of ties. On many occasions I’ve said that and I’d like to reiterate. I’m deeply convinced that the Ukrainian people and the Russian people are not simply close relatives. They are almost the same. As for the language, the culture, the history, each certainly has to be treated with respect. And even when we were one single country, we treated them with respect. Suffice it to say that the whole of the Soviet Union for decades, was managed by those who originated from Ukraine. I think that testifies to a lot. STONE: Yes, but economically, as you say, you’re self-sufficient. They’re gone—let them have their problems. It’s not going to destroy your country. PUTIN: No, certainly—not in the least. STONE: One point you made in our last meeting. I asked, “What about the Russian submarine base in Crimea?” Sebastopol I think it was. And you said it was not important because you have another base across the water—somewhere around here. In other words, you weren’t threatened by the loss of the base. That’s what you told me at the time. PUTIN: Losing the base in Sebastopol was a threat, but it was not too sensitive. Because by that time … right now we are commissioning a new military base—indeed not far from here in Novorossiysk. What was presenting certain difficulties to us was the severing of ties between the companies of the defense sector. Because the defense sectors of Ukraine and Russia during the Soviet period were one single system. And if these relations were severed, then that certainly would lead to a certain negative impact on our defense industry. But we have devised a whole system for input-substitution as we call it. And right now, we are actively surmounting all of these difficulties. We are establishing new enterprises from scratch, and these enterprises produce a new generation of military equipment. And that defense industry in Ukraine which used to provide support to Russia is now simply dying out—I’m talking about the missile industry, aircraft industry and also engine construction. STONE: I understand. In other words, the US succeeded in starting the coup, and winning as they did many times over the years. And it was a loss, but not a fatal loss. PUTIN: You could say that. Moreover, when I say that we started establishing new enterprises that help propel us to new technological levels, I often cite this example. All of our helicopters used to be equipped with engines produced in Ukraine—100% of our helicopters. Once the supplies from Ukraine stopped, we built a new plant, right now we are completing another one. All helicopters can fly—fully functional—and we have engines of a new generation. So as you can see, what our air force is doing in Syria testifies to the fact that we are doing quite well. STONE: Even if NATO entered into an agreement with Ukraine, I still don’t see too much of a threat, with the new weaponry. PUTIN: I see a threat. This threat consists of the fact that once NATO comes to this or that country, then as a whole the political leadership of that country, as well as the population there, cannot influence the decisions NATO makes—including the decisions related to stationing the military infrastructure. Even very sensitive weapons systems can be deployed. I’m talking also about the antiballistic missile systems. And that means that we would have to respond somehow to that. STONE: Plus all the weapons we’ve put into the Baltic States? PUTIN: I’m talking about this strategic anti-ballistic missile system (ABMs). There are only two facilities like that in Eastern Europe—in Romania and in Poland. And at sea in the Mediterranean, there are plans to deploy these systems on ships. Right now negotiations are under way to do the same in South Korea. All that certainly creates a threat to our nuclear deterrence system. Let me remind you that I myself proposed to our American partners that we should work on these systems together. What would that imply? That would imply that we would designate the missile threats together, and we would create a joint system for ABM management. Then we would exchange technological information. And all of that in my view would spell cardinal drastic changes in the world as far as national security is concerned. I’m not going into details right now. But our proposal was declined by our American counterparts, [as I’ve said many times]. STONE: Of course. Okay. But it seems to me that Russia adapts and you are adapting to these ABMs. Am I wrong? PUTIN: We have these capabilities, we are improving them, and when we talked with our American counterparts, we told them that we deemed the construction of those systems as a threat, and they always responded that this was not against us. This was against the missile aspirations of Iran. As of now an agreement has been reached, fortunately, with Iran. But the deployment of this system still goes forward. What does it tell us? We were right. But back then when we were discussing that, w',\n",
       "  'e were saying we would have to take actions in response, and these actions were to partly consist in improving our offensive capabilities. Their response was as follows. The ABM system they told us was not established against us. And what we were going to do—that is, to improve our own offensive capability—would be considered by the United States as not aimed against the United States. And we agreed on that. STONE: You know, the American Indians made treaties with the US government and they were the first to experience the treachery of the US government. You’re not the first. PUTIN: We wouldn’t like to be the last. [laughter] STONE: In that regard, I’d like to show you a piece of film from Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” set in the war rooms of the United States. One scene we can see and then if you like we can see another one. But first, to just finish this Ukraine thing. My ultimate question is, in hindsight, looking back, did you make a mistake by annexing Crimea because it cost you tremendously—the sanctions, the whole EU turns on Russia, the US—it becomes big news because it’s regarded as illegal in the international post-war treaty world. Not to say that other people haven’t broken their treaties, but … Anyway, it did cost you big time and you perhaps miscalculated. Perhaps you thought it would be acceptable in some way. Have you ever thought about that decision in retrospect? PUTIN: We did not force Crimea into Russia. Those who live in Crimea have decided to join Russia. And when following this path we were very cautious, and in full compliance with international law and the United Nations charter. The first thing that was done in Crimea itself was not by us, but by those who inhabit Crimea. The legitimate parliament of Crimea that was elected based on the Ukrainian legislation, announced a referendum. The Crimean parliament, by an overwhelming vote, decided, after the referendum, to join Russia. I know of no other way that would be more democratic to address issues of this kind than the free will of the people. The expression of this free will, was that an overwhelming majority had voted for independence and for joining Russia. On the whole, during the referendum, it was 90 percent or even more. If there is a better or more democratic way to address this issue, please tell me about that. Today, I hear only the opinion that contains the attempt at justifying that our actions, with regard to Crimea, were not correct. That is, the central authorities of Ukraine did not agree to that. That’s what they argue. But let me remind you that when a decision on Kosovo’s independence was taken, the United Nations International Court of Justice decided that on issues related to independence and self-determination, no consent from the central authorities of this or that country were required. And please say for those who will see this film [or read this transcript], that the letter from the State Department of the United States addressed to the UN Security Council on this matter says the State Department supports Kosovo’s decision on independence wholeheartedly. Other European countries spoke in the same vein. And in this regard I do not quite understand why the Kosovars would have these rights, whereas Russians, Ukrainians, and Crimean Tatars who live in Crimea in a similar situation would not enjoy the same rights. I think that is absolutely unacceptable. That is what we call having double standards. And we do not regret anything. This is not just about the future of Soviet territories. We’re talking about the future of millions of people, and we didn’t have a choice, really. Only one decision was possible—to agree with this request from the Crimeans about the reunification with Russia. Just one more thing—our troops were there. But these troops didn’t take a single shot. The only thing they did was to create conditions for these elections to take place and for the referendum to take place. And I reiterate, even though I said that on many occasions, in the course of these events there was not a single victim. STONE: Let me put it this way—did you expect to be excommunicated by the European community because of this? PUTIN: Certainly I did expect this kind of reaction. But before making this decision, we had conducted a very deep social research in Russia, and the overwhelming majority of Russian citizens—around 80 percent or more—when responding to the question whether it was possible to re-unify Crimea with Russia, even though that would mean a deterioration of relations with the West and other countries of the world, they said yes they thought it was possible. So when making this decision, I was guided not by the preferences of my counterparts from other countries. I responded to the sentiment of the Russian people. STONE: And the Crimeans as of this date, are they grateful? Or are they pissed off? VP; There are many problems in Crimea, but on the whole, people support the decision which was taken. The best estimate of that support was the poll that was recently conducted in Crimea because the Kiev authorities tried to set up an energy blockade of the peninsula. The overwhelming majority—I’m talking about the same figures—the overwhelming majority re-affirmed the decision they had made earlier on joining Russia. STONE: And Donbass? Well, this is a real problem, I guess, in terms of the thorn that doesn’t go away. How do you get out of this one? PUTIN: Certainly, I think the Minsk Agreement has to be implemented. STONE: But it doesn’t seem like Kiev has any intention of doing so. PUTIN: I do have all the plans, and the Russian leadership as a whole, we have these plans. But the key components of the Minsk agreements are the political components, and the main political component is to make amendments to the Ukrainian constitution. It should have been done, not by us, but by the Kiev authorities, by the end of 2015. And a law on amnesty has to be adopted and it has to have force. It has been adopted, but it has not been promulgated by the president. A special status law in these territories has to be enforced. This law has also been adopted. It has been voted on by the Ukrainian parliament but it has not been enforced. We cannot do that for them. But I’m hopeful that in the end this is going to be done. And the conflict is going to end. STONE: So we should maybe look at some film? We’ll adjust the lights and darken the room. You can sit there and we can talk about the scenes afterw'],\n",
       " ['by William Wolf Ingmar Bergman stands outside his ranch house on Fårö, his Swedish island sanctuary, one arm affectionately around his wife, the other waving an enthusiastic welcome. He flashes a broad smile, almost a grin. There is nothing to suggest the brooding genius one might expect from stories about Bergman’s anxieties and from his films that have probed despair and isolation. During the next three hours it would become apparent that there is a new, liberated Ingmar Bergman. At 62, he is as work-obsessed as ever and worried that his filmmaking days may be ending, but the upheaval in his life—set off when he was hauled out of a rehearsal at the Royal Dramatic Theater, in Stockholm, in January 1976 and grilled at police headquarters by over zealous tax inspectors —forced him out of the shadows. Now he not only enjoys traveling and working abroad but has a new interest—playing paterfamilias to the clan resulting from his string of marriages, official and unofficial. Although publicity-shy, he has even agreed to help promote Scandinavian films. In past visits to New York, Bergman tried to remain incognito. This week, he is due to arrive for the opening of the Museum of Modem Art’s “Scandinavia: New Films” program, which begins October 30 and marks a combined effort by Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Finland to crack the American market. He will also be plugging his own new German film, From the Life of the Marionettes, another searing dissection of a marital relationship, this one exploding in murder. Marionettes won’t be shown at MOMA, but the series will include his fascinating Fårö Document 1979, an update of the film he made ten years earlier, depicting the rigors of life on his cherished island. En route to the Fårö (pronounced For-EH) rendezvous with the director, I wondered how much more one could expect from ',\n",
       "  'a man who has already explored the soul and has analyzed men and women in relation to themselves, to others, and to the profound philosophical questions that have perplexed human beings through the ages. Can he equal or surpass such masterpieces as The Seventh Seal, Winter Light, Wild Strawberries, The Silence, Persona, The Passion of Anna, Cries and Whispers, Scenes From a Marriage? Geographically, Bergman is as remote as some find his films. First there’s a chartered plane from Stockholm to the ancient city of Visby, on the Baltic island of Gotland, a 40-minute bouncing ride to a car ferry, a 15-minute chug across the water to bleak-looking Fårö, another 15 minutes past mostly barren land, then along a winding, treelined dirt road leading to fenced-off property with a sign warning, security alarm. Plus special permission from the Swedish military authorities, since Fårö, facing the Soviet Union, 100 miles away, is an outpost in Sweden’s defense system. Are there radar installations? “I’m not allowed to say,” Bergman demurs, laughing at the idea of attaching security importance to this tiny isle. Then he leads the way along the stony beach to show off his panoramic sea view. “I first came here to film Through a Glass Darkly and fell in love with the island. But I had a lot of trouble getting permission when I decided to build this house. You need permission for everything. It’s a simple house.” True, the gray wooden structure isn’t ostentatious, but it is impressively spacious, with a sizable swimming pool hidden behind it. “Mostly I enjoyed it here because it is so peaceful. When the sea is silent, it is very strange. But it is never frightening.” Suddenly his tone grows somber. He could have been setting the scene for one of his films. “There was a time when I was frightened. It happened one night about five years ago, whe',\n",
       "  'n there was a strange light to the sky. I had this horrible feeling that something was going to happen. And the next morning they found two fishermen had drowned just here.” His mellifluous voice is already beginning to have a mesmerizing effect; his manner establishes immediate intimacy, and he laughs easily and frequently. “Let’s talk seriously after lunch,” he says pleasantly but decisively. His wife, Ingrid (another Ingrid Bergman), to whom he has been married for ten years, has prepared a smorgasbord that includes gravlax, salad, and a huge bowl of luscious raspberries (“They were picked today by a neighbor”) served with fresh cream. Although it is midday, candles illuminate the table in the dining area of their large, knotty-pine-paneled, modern kitchen. Bergman rations himself to a small bowl of raspberries mixed with sour milk. We have coffee in the simply furnished living room, which contains a few paintings and a driftwood sculpture. Near the elevated fireplace, wood is neatly stacked. There is a large television and a videotape machine, with a shelf full of cassettes. In a corner, a handsome grandfather clock ticks away as if auditioning for a Bergman film. Bergman doesn’t recoil at being asked whether he has anything more to say in his films or is in danger of drying up. “I have thousands of ideas. That’s not the problem, because I still have an enormous desire to make pictures. I have many things to talk about because of my fascination with the human being, the human face—which fascinates me more and more—all the dimensions of reality, and the conditions of human life, of the human being.” But he confesses to the doubts that have been nagging at him in the last decade. “The problem is that I’m 62 years old. I have been in this business 40 years, and more and more I feel it physically. I get tired. Making a pictur',\n",
       "  'e is a very tough job. It gets harder and harder, and I can feel that my health isn’t what it was five or ten years ago. I don’t think that has affected my film-making yet, but there is a risk that one day I’ll feel that, no, I don’t want any more, I’m too tired. Not bored, but too tired to start a new picture. I have decided that I don’t want to wait for somebody to come in and tell me, ‘Ingmar, it is better for you not to make this picture because physically you can’t take it anymore.’ So one day I’ll say to myself, ‘No, Ingmar, it’s over.’ “Sometimes during the last ten years, when I have been shooting a picture, I’ve been very close to this decision. You know, I’m sleepless—that’s my great problem. I sleep no more than four or five hours a night. I can be very tired in the morning when I have to go to the studio, and I think this will be my last picture, because I can’t stand it anymore. Then the picture is finished, and I rest a little.’’ Could he really walk away from it all? “Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. Because the theater is there, and that’s something else. You can come at 10 a.m., go to the rehearsal room, rehearse for four and a half hours, and say, ‘Today it was not so very good, but it will be better tomorrow, or Saturday, or Monday.’ So, I hope to have the opportunity to work in the theater all my life.’’ Bergman has been staging plays in Munich, but there has been sporadic talk of his coming to New York to do Ibsen’s Rosmersholm, with Liv Ullmann. “I would find that fascinating, but the problem in New York is that there is one star. The other actors are good but not excellent. In Munich you can have the best actors for all the parts. And in New York, rehearsal time is so short—about four weeks. In Munich I rehearsed The Three Sisters for fifteen weeks. And even if you get bad reviews in four papers, the audiences a',\n",
       "  're so educated that they don’t believe what they read and go to see for themselves.” Bergman’s film company is based in Munich, where he spends half the year. For tax purposes, he can’t spend more than six months a year in Sweden, but Bergman now feels free to return to the homeland he fled in bewilderment and anger. The charges of fraud crushed him and precipitated a nervous break-down. Subsequently, a new Swedish administration exonerated him completely and apologized. “It was almost five years ago, and it’s over, far away. The authorities made a big mistake. It is very seldom that a bureaucracy apologizes. But what happened almost killed me. Of course, it was also stimulating and good for me, because I had once thought it impossible to work abroad. But I had to go away somewhere. I went to New York and Los Angeles and Paris and Berlin and Copenhagen and Paris again, and Munich, and back to Los Angeles. It was fascinating. Anyhow, this fear of traveling, fear of flying—I don’t have it anymore. But we don’t want to go over everything again. It was part of a political attack. They wanted a scapegoat, but the whole thing is over.” Bergman’s wife is more agitated, less forgiving. “My heart starts beating fast when I think of it. They treat people like Ingmar worse than anyone else.” ‘‘Please, Ingrid, let’s not go into it,” he implores. Mrs. Bergman is known to be extremely devoted to her husband and protective of him. Unlike the actresses who have shared his life (Harriet Andersson, Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, and who knows how many others), she nurtures no desire for an artistic career. Formerly in her family’s import-export business, she now manages the details of Bergman’s production company. The Bergmans have no household help; Ingrid does everything herself. About to go away for three days, she has prepared all of her hus',\n",
       "  'band’s food in advance. He won’t answer the phone, so she does; she encourages and organizes family reunions, even though it means a staggering workload. “The first time all of our children ever met was two years ago, for Ingmar’s sixtieth birthday,” she says. “They liked it tremendously and come back now and again. They really know each other now and like to sit talking night after night, like sisters and brothers. This summer they were all here again.” Bergman is ebullient in describing the summer reunion. A few years ago, Liv Ullmann told me of Bergman’s difficulty in relating to their daughter, Linn, but predicted that when Linn grew older, they’d have more in common. “All eight of my children were here, and Ingrid has four children from another marriage. They were here too. We had boyfriends and girl friends, wives and husbands, and grandchildren. Sometimes it’s very tiring, so I have to go into the studio to rest. But I like it tremendously.” Bergman’s work facilities on Fårö are in another house a few kilometers away. “I bought a farm that’s 150 years old, and there I have a screening room, cutting tables, everything I need.” His move to Munich posed many problems—adjusting to his self-imposed exile, working in languages other than Swedish. His first expatriate film was The Serpent’s Egg. “The film was a complete failure, but even failures can be interesting.” After his next film, the acclaimed Autumn Sonata, made in Norway, Bergman returned to Fårö to make Fårö Document 1979. “In a way the film was a medicine, a remedy, coming back here, you know. Here are my sources, my roots. It’s the only place in the world where I feel really at home. There are about 500 inhabitants on the island, and I did a lot of interviews. To talk with my friends here, their problems, their lives, to look at them when they are at work—this wa',\n",
       "  's extremely personal to me.” Bergman has finished a new script for his next project. He is reluctant to talk about a work in progress, but someone close to him who has read the screenplay says that it again draws upon his childhood experiences. Fanny and Alexander, geared for both a television series and for a shorter version for theatrical distribution, is budgeted at $7 million and will star Max von Sydow, Liv Ullmann, and Erland Josephson. Although set in 1910, the analogy is obvious. Von Sydow plays a minister whose rigidity resembles the well-known authoritarianism of Bergman’s father, also a minister. He locks his children in a closet for punishment, as Bergman’s father did, and comes to a horrendous end. His sister catches fire in her bed, runs to him for help, and they both burn to death. Bergman has often spoken about the scars left by his childhood. “But my neuroses are not in relation to my work. At least I have the illusion that my work is very unneurotic.” Bergman fled his home and didn’t see his parents for four years. Eventually he came to a better understanding with them. He even finds positive results amid the psychic damage. Punctuality is one. “As a child I was a dreamer. Time didn’t exist for me, and my father was not very sentimental in that respect, so he educated me in a very tough way. When I went to school I could be one, two, or three hours late when I came home. That was not very good for my backside. Now I hate to steal time from anybody, because I hate when time is stolen from me. If I say to somebody that we will meet at ten o’clock, I will be there five minutes before. So I am grateful to my father.” Talking with Bergman, it is easy to understand how he elicits such magnificent performances. Harriet Andersson says, “When he puts his arm around you, watch out.” He looks at you directly, and his g',\n",
       "  'entle, intimate manner suggests how he coaxes actors into doing anything he asks by inspiring their unswerving trust. Gunnel Lindblom, a Bergman actress who now directs her own films, thinks she understands why he is particularly successful directing women: “It isn’t just that he likes women—he is interested in learning more about them.” How does Bergman describe his methods? “It depends on whether you are making a film or directing a play. In the theater you can stop the work and sit down with an actor to discuss the problems. Filming is, of course, a sort of factory. You have to make three minutes of the picture every day. Everything, every detail, must be absolutely prepared. Everybody, not only the actors, but all my collaborators, must know exactly what to do at every moment. Only then can we improvise. “Most important, I think, is to create an atmosphere of security, of calm, of silence in the studio. It’s a very tough job, most tough for the actors because they are so exposed. They stay there with their voices and their faces and require a feeling of absolute confidence. They must be relaxed, and I have to create that atmosphere.” I tell him that actress Ingrid Bergman was surprised at his way of getting her to express herself in Autumn Sonata, when he would tell her to think of things that had nothing to do with the scene. “Oh, yes,” he confirms. “It is meaningless to talk in an intellectual way when our situation is completely emotional. The intellectual discussion must have been cleared out before the start of the picture, because once we are completely in the middle of the emotional process, you have to talk in emotional terms. You can say to an actor, ‘You feel heavy like a stone,’ and an actor knows exactly what you mean and transforms his body. And when he has the lines to complete the emotion, then you will hav',\n",
       "  'e an expression. In the beginning, Ingrid Bergman was very angry, because when we were shooting I didn’t look at her. ‘Why do you not look at me?’ she asked. I said, ‘If I hear that your voice is correct, I know that you look correct.’ ” Hollywood has always been a lure for foreign directors. Now that he likes to travel, would Bergman venture into Lotusland? He is ambivalent. “I very much admire the American way of filmmaking. It’s very vital, and extremely stimulating. And American directors have taught me a lot. In the 1930s, I started my filmgoing with American films. I would see two or three movies a day. Of course, I had to become good friends with the projectionists, because I had no money. I learned from the films of Billy Wilder, Ernst Lubitsch, George Cukor. To go to America, to live there, to make a picture with American actors and in American studios could be a marvelous, exciting experience, but just an experience. It could be very difficult, like going to Japan and trying to make a samurai picture. And if an American director tries to make a picture in European style—as, for instance, Woody Allen tried with Interiors—he comes into great difficulties. I think the picture is wonderful—I love it. But the critics didn’t.” (This critic agrees with Bergman.) Bergman has a personal collection of some 500 films. “I’ve concentrated on silent films and early talkies because the other pictures I can get from the companies. In the summer, almost every evening, we went to the movies in the barn. While the children were here, we saw about 40 pictures. Then we sat together and discussed them. It’s lots of fun. I like very much to go to the movies. There are not many directors who do. It’s from my childhood. Fellini, fratello mio, and I feel the same way. He likes to go to the movies more than to the theater. I almost never walk',\n",
       "  ' out on a movie. Maybe once or twice.” Is there any new direction that he would like to take in his filmmaking? A new approach, a new technique perhaps? “I would like once in my life to make a 120-minute picture with just one close-up. I think it’s impossible, but I would love to do it once. To have the right actor and to have the talent to accomplish this. It would be the most fascinating experience of all, just to look with the camera. I am a voyeur. To look at somebody, to find out how the skin changes, the eyes, how all those muscles change the whole time—the lips—to me it’s always a drama. Sven [the brilliant cinematographer Sven Nykvist, Bergman’s longtime collaborator] and I have been experimenting with how to light close-ups, and perhaps to make that picture, black and white would be better than color, because color is never true. Black and white is, strange to say, more true because then your fantasy is created; you have created it yourself. “We made From the Life of the Marionettes in black and white, the first picture in almost ten years we did that way. We start in color, and then after about three or four minutes go over to black and white, and then the last two or three minutes are in color. Perhaps I’m wrong, but to me the great gift of cinematography is the human face. Don’t you think so? With a camera you can go into the stomach of a kangaroo. But to look at the human face, I think, is the most fascinating.” Bergman refused to permit a professional photographer to come to the island to try to capture his face, but he says “of course” when I ask him and his wife to pose for an amateur. While fiddling with the focusing, I suggest, “We should have Sven Nykvist here.” Bergman laughs. “Oh, no. He’s a very bad photographer. You can’t imagine how bad until you see his private pictures.” New York Magazine, October 27'],\n",
       " ['Alfred Hitchcock and Saboteur It was 1941, and Alfred Hitchcock had a picture about to be released called Suspicion, with Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. He came to New York for the premiere of the picture at Radio City Music Hall, which was the most desirable place to open. He had been brought to America and put under contract by David O. Selznick, and was preparing a picture called Saboteur, with a script by Dorothy Parker, Alan Campbell, Joan Harrison and Peter Viertel. Hitchcock was looking for someone to play the title role of the saboteur; he wanted an unknown because of the nature of the story. He mentioned this to John Houseman, who was also working for Selznick, and Houseman suggested to him that I might be right for the part. Houseman also got in touch with me, telling me to call Hitchcock at the St. Regis, which I did, using Houseman’s name to get through to Hitch. He was very kind and polite and suggested I come to see him. I did so, and it was the start of a relationship that went on for over thirty-five years. Hitchcock had made only two pictures in America — Suspicion and Rebecca — after his English work, but it impressed me, as I came into his presence, that he was the definition, in one’s imagina\\xadtion, of an international motion picture director. I don’t mean in the cliché Hollywood style, or as in a George S. Kaufman comedy, but in the sense of a director one felt to be a major figure in the contemporary entertainment world. It was more than that; it was an international aura of St. Moritz, trains, the best food, cigars, rare wines — all the fantasies that you saw on the screen, he seemed to em\\xadbody in the way he lived. Actually, only part of that was true. He had a great sense of that world but he lived very quietly, like a bourgeois. He projected a professionalism, a big-league quality, immediately, and he was very much at ease. He was then in his early forties. He told me what he had in mind and said that he would have me tested; he didn’t do the tests, because he had to go back to Los Angeles. I was to select a scene with a character who was like the character in the film, which he described to me. We had a chat about Houseman and Hitch’s new picture, Suspicion, and the fact that I had also seen his English work. I had seen the first of his films to be released in America, including The Man Who Knew Too Much, during the run of Noah, because Pierre Fresnay was in it. Then came The Thirty-Nine Steps, and The Girl Was Young. He was considered an arty director then; these were released as art films. I selected a scene from Blind Alley, a successful play of which variations have since been made — Desperate Hours and Detective Story: people held hostage by the criminal. I played the criminal in a short scene — less than two minutes. It was a single shot, with cues thrown to me from off-stage. There were also other actors testing. The film was sent off to Hitchc',\n",
       "  'ock and he selected me. I was overwhelmed. I was paid three hundred dollars a week to play a title role in a film and was guaranteed four weeks. I had to pay a commission and living expenses out of this. They also had me stay on two extra days, for which they did not pay me, but gave me twenty-five dol\\xadlars a day for expenses. I was given round-trip transpor\\xadtation by plane. That was my first trip to California by air, which in those days was a journey of about twenty- one hours. You slept in a berth on the plane. There were several stops. Hitch never referred to the test again although he had hired me on the basis of it. The producer, Jack Skirball, did. He was then a theatre exhibitor, financier and in partnership with Bruce Manning. Together, they were producing the film independently at old Universal. Hitchcock was on loan-out from Selznick. Jack Skirball was very kind and hospitable. One day he took me out to dinner and told me, “You know that test? I thought you overdid it.” He was probably right. Theatre acting was then a lot more florid than it is today, and it could well have been that I did a lot of “acting” to make the character of the psychopathic killer convince Hitchcock that I could be a deranged saboteur. In fact, that part was written quite differently. Saboteur starred Robert Cummings, Priscilla Lane and some very good character actors like Otto Kruger, Egon Brecher, Alma Kruger, Alan Baxter and Ian Wolfe. Hitch was shooting when I arrived. I came on the set and he greeted me most charmingly. I waited. The shooting day was almost over and he invited me for a drink. This was my first experience drinking with Hitchcock; from then on, I was on my guard. We went across the street from the lovely old Univer\\xadsal lot to a bar and restaurant run by one of the prop men, Eddie Keyes. Hitch ordered a martini, and I said I would have the same. When Hitch’s “usual” arrived, it was in a goblet the size of those used to serve grapefruit, when the grapefruit is surrounded by ice. Mine, of course, was the same. I looked at it with fear. At no time in my life have I been much of a drinker; I was also not accustomed to driving, having learned when I was in Hollywood in 1939 with Orson, and not having driven in New York since. The drink made me fear for my safety; on the other hand, I was afraid that if I didn’t drink it, I might lose the part. I just sipped while Hitch drank one, then another. He never got drunk; it was his normal appetite. Before I came to Hollywood, I had done some second unit work on the picture in New York. Once I was cast in the part, Hitch sent John Fulton to New York to direct the unit. He was the foremost trick cameraman in Hol\\xadlywood; if you needed effects shot, he was the best man in town and, in his own way, a star. The Statue of Liberty sequence has become one of the most famous Hitchcock ever made, and in the years since Saboteur I have often bee',\n",
       "  'n asked how it was done. Audiences seem to know more about technical matters these days, perhaps because of the proliferation of all kinds of cameras. But at that time, audiences couldn’t understand how the sequence was shot. That was precisely the effect that Hitchcock desired because as a director, as a man of great visual power, he looked for a style that would not only give the audience the emotional kick that he hoped for but would also leave them puz\\xadzled. I will get to the specifics of that as I lay out the se\\xadquence, which is probably my claim to fame, for people always say, “Oh yes — you fell off the Statue of Liberty.” In the story of Saboteur, my character commits the crime at the beginning of the film and the entire picture is a chase. Bob Cummings, the hero, tries to find and cap\\xadture me. Two or three reels from the end, he finds me just as I’m about to blow up a boat — a Liberty ship carrying goods for the war. At one point I run into Radio City Music Hall. I find my way onto the stage, and behind me a picture is play\\xading on an enormous screen. A gunfight ensues between Bob Cummings, the detectives, and me. They are shoot\\xading from the audience; I’m shooting from the stage. At the same time, a gun-fight is in progress on the screen, so it is never clear where the sound of revolvers is coming from; you’re not sure if it’s from the screen, my revolver, or Cummings’s. A man in the audience falls over dead, clearly shot by me from the stage, with only the woman next to him aware of it. The essence of the Hitchcock touch in that sequence was not only the intermingling of reality, so to speak, with film, but also the humor of the situation, in which the audience continued to think all the shots being fired were on the screen; they were laughing. They were never aware of the real gun battle. From there — in the continuity of the story, not in the order in which the film was shot (the Radio City Music Hall sequence was done in Hollywood) — I take a cab going down the West Side Highway. This, too, was done in Hollywood as a process shot. While we were shooting in California, news reached us that the Normandie was burning. This French ship was at that time the largest in the world; it was being prepared for the troops to use when it was sabotaged. In flames, the ship had keeled over. Hitch asked Universal Newsreel division, which existed at that time, to get some footage of the boat burn\\xading. He also had them shoot plates of a car going down the West Side Highway — an elevated structure which bordered the west side of Manhattan along the docks. He put me in a mock-up of a taxi and said, “When I cue you, look to your right as if you see the Normandie.” He wanted a look that would be used as a cut — the jux\\xadtaposition of going down the highway, then a turn of the head with a slight smile, and the cut of the boat burning; it all tied together, indicating I had something to d',\n",
       "  'o with the burning boat. It is remembered as a chilling moment. From a directorial point of view, it shows a man who was really on his toes and aware of any opportunity to create something for his film: to take history at the mo\\xadment and incorporate it into a script — in character, story and action. Hitch always claimed the contrary: “I lay out the script shot for shot. It’s boring to shoot a picture be\\xadcause I’ve done it all in the script.” But that was an ex\\xadample of his not having done this. It was history and ab\\xadsolutely memorable. The cab arrived at the Battery at the tip of Manhattan. In those days an aquarium was there, and the docks from which boats left for the Statue of Liberty, on Bedloe’s Is\\xadland. When we shot there with John Fulton’s second unit, it was December 15th, 1941, a few days after Pearl Harbor, but it was supposed to be spring. It was very cold, but I could not wear my hat and coat for the scene. I went into the warmth of the little office where tickets for the Statue of Liberty boats were sold. Thirty-five extras were wait\\xading. Coffee and doughnuts were being served while the first shots of my arriving at the ticket office, then ascend\\xading the gangplank of the boat, were being prepared. John Fulton was also going to shoot plates to be used on Stage 12 at Universal when we went to California. We had a big problem that day with clouds; it was overcast, so John did not have the light that he wanted much of the time. We did a lot of waiting; we would do two or three takes and wait again. After the scene at the gangplank, which we did two or three times, we did the scene on the boat, going across the water. I went out on deck to the railing at the front of the boat to look at Pris\\xadcilla Lane, whom I was trying to pick up, at the opposite railing. Fulton also had to shoot plates for Priscilla Lane, who wasn’t there, as well as my plates and shots of me looking into the bay. The extras were in these scenes, which we shot several times. Next, we landed on Bedloe’s Island where we shot coming off the boat four times, again waiting for the right light. From there, we did a shot walking from the land\\xading up to the base of the Statue of Liberty, also requiring several takes. It was then time to eat, and box lunches ar\\xadrived. One little old lady who was obediently repeating all these actions with the extras finally turned to one of them and said, “Do you have to do this every time you want to see the Statue of Liberty?” She had come from Virginia and had decided to see the statue the first thing in the morning» Wandering into the nice group of people who were having coffee and doughnuts, she had thought, “My goodness, what are all of these terrible stories I hear about New York? They’ve made me feel welcome with coffee and doughnuts, although they have this curious way of making you repeat all these things to see the statue.” It was explained to her that she was a',\n",
       "  'ctually in the middle of thirty extras making pictures. She disap\\xadpeared; to this day the mystery has never been solved. It’s my own conclusion that she jumped in the bay, though they tell me that’s not the case. Whatever hap\\xadpened to her, no one knows, because they were looking for her to sign a release. This was needed for anyone who was going to be seen on film — which she was. Finally, we did the scene going into the base of the Statue of Liberty. This was it for the day; Fulton had his plates and live-action of me. John then went to the top of the statue, to shoot plates from there to the base, the bay, the harbor and so on. This done, I went to California to perform in the picture. Saboteur is remembered chiefly for the Statue of Liber\\xadty sequence. In the story, after my character has gone into the base of the statue, Bob Cummings and the FBI men arrive. Priscilla Lane had been on the boat with me. I go up to the crown of the statue and she follows me. Her job is to detain me long enough for the FBI to reach me. I have a scene with her in which I go on the make and she goes along with it to hold me there. At the end of the scene, she speaks my name and I realize that I have been trapped. I look out and see speedboats arriving, which would not normally happen at Bedloe’s Island. I move out of the inside of the crown and onto its balcony. I did not do this on the real Statue of Liberty, of course. Hitchcock had the hand, torch and balcony built to scale on stage twelve of Universal. It was enormous. Parallels had been built out to the balcony with mattres\\xadses. The inside of the crown was also built to scale, as all the dialogue scenes were done by Hitch at Universal. Bob Cummings came out onto the balcony, following me. As we moved around, he pulled a gun and made a gesture towards me with it, I panicked and went over the balcony railing onto the parallel covered with mattres\\xadses, where I was caught by a grip named Scotty who was stationed to make sure I wouldn’t go off the parapet. At this point, Hitch switched to doubles. For the long shot, Davey Sharp, one of the greatest of stuntmen, repeated my fall backwards over the railing, through the air. He then caught the crotch of the thumb and forefinger on the statue and held on with both hands. Bob Cummings’s stunt double, also in long shot, climbed down the forefinger to try to rescue me; Fry, the character I played, had to be taken alive to be persuaded to talk. When Hitch returned to close-ups, he disassembled the torch piece. He put the thumb and forefinger piece of the torch, and the crotch of the thumb and the forefinger, down on the floor of the stage. The camera was angled at me lying on my stomach on the set piece, and 1 did all the close-up reactions there. Bob Cummings came down the forefinger, but could only reach the sleeve of my jacket. There were then intercuts between my close-up, Bob Cummings’s close-up a',\n",
       "  'nd the seam where the sleeve was stitched to the jacket, which began to tear. Bob tried to get my hand to prevent me from falling, pulling the sleeve to bring me closer to him. But my hand was clinging to the statue, and he couldn’t get a grip on me. Eventually the sleeve came off and I fell, from a big close-up. I fell without a cut to the base of the statue, one continuous scream all the way down. That is what Hitch was building up to; that is the problem he had set for himself. The fall had to be done without a cut from a close-up. People have wondered how we did that to this day. When Ben Hecht saw the sequence — referring to the sleeve that parted from my jacket — he told Hitchcock he thought I should have had a better tailor. Hitch himself decided that the only problem with the sequence, which is technically supreme, was that the story had the wrong man in jeopardy. It should have been the hero, he thought. He concluded that the scene on the hand of the statue, with all the technical and cinematic wizardry to hype up the audience, would have been more affecting had Bob Cummings been in jeopardy. John Fulton designed the falling scene in consultation with Hitch. Hitch knew a great deal about art direction; he had worked as an art director in silent films in London when he was young. He also knew more about trick photog\\xadraphy than most people, so he could talk to Johnny Fulton as a peer. This is how they did it. The removable piece of the statue — the thumb and forefinger — was taken to another stage and attached to a platform six feet high. The platform was on counterweights and rigged to the top of the stage. A hole was cut in the platform, with a camera placed to shoot down through the hole, towards the set piece fixed below it. Underneath the whole thing was a saddle-like affair on which I sat, on a pipe about four-and-a-half feet high, based on a black cloth. On a cue, the camera, on the counterweight system, starting from a close-up of me, would go up in the air to the grid, together with the set piece of the thumb and forefinger, leaving me behind; thus giving the effect of falling. This was shot at different speeds, while I did move\\xadments of falling rather slowly and balletically. By the time the camera got to the top of its move, it had gone from an extreme close-up to a very long shot of my ap\\xadparently falling figure. The small saddle was not visible; the pipe and black cloth, which were seen, were later painted out in a traveling matte shot. Hitch succeeded in achieving what he wanted, which was to do the fall in one cut. I was so fortunate to make my first picture with Hitchcock. I started at the top, and was introduced to a way of picture-making, a way of conducting oneself on the set—a way of life regarding a picture—that of an in\\xadternational star director. Not only was he an artist, but there was a very special world which he projected. Hitch always dresse',\n",
       "  'd in a black suit, white shirt and black tie. He looked like either a banker or an undertaker. He ac\\xadtually had twenty-eight of these suits, all the same. The coats and trousers were marked with corresponding num\\xadbers, so they wouldn’t get matched in the wrong way; this was done for dry cleaning purposes. It was characteristic of his mind — so well organized. He would walk on the set and conduct it as if it were a fine banking firm in England — very quiet and masterful. But he had great humor and a sense of fun. He still had remnants of his gift for practical jokes at that time, and sometimes played them; they were always very funny. He left an indelible mark on me of what it means to be a director and how to conduct oneself on the set. Chaplin and Renoir, with whom I worked later, each had a unique genius. Chaplin was a nineteenth-century romantic; he still had the flavor of silent pictures which caused him to work the way he did in my experience on Limelight. Renoir was a man of enormous personal charm, a humanist, erudite and witty. He was a prince of the human race. My friendship with Jean was a very loving and close one quite apart from pictures. Hitch was really what you dreamed about when you picked up chic magazines — Vanity Fair, Harper’s Bazaar or Vogue, and saw international salons with motion pic\\xadture directors. He was St. Moritz and the Orient Express — all the fantasies a New York actor without any money would savor. PARKER: Why was Saboteur made as an independent production? LLOYD: Jack Skirball had bought the property. He had done a few pictures previously, and went on to do Shadow of a Doubt with Hitchcock later. Hitch actually developed Saboteur. I don’t know whether or not Selznick turned down the story, but he loaned Hitch to Skirball for this production. As a director, Hitch often used the phrase “camera logic.” He believed in a simple camera: it is exactly in the right place at the right time to tell the story. Joe Valen\\xadtine, one of the top cameramen in Hollywood, shot Saboteur in black and white. Early on he asked Hitch if he would like to look at a shot through the camera. Hitch told him no, thank you; he had looked through a camera before. He never looked through the camera. He knew exactly the image that he wanted; he would ask the cameraman what lens he was using and where he was cutting the actor, at the knees or at the chest, etc. Upon receiving this information, he was ready to shoot. His chair was put alongside the camera. I began to learn about the camera from Hitch — then, and also later, when we worked together on the television series. It was a source of pride that major directors sel\\xaddom moved the camera, and would only move it if there was a real motivation for doing so, in the case of an actor moving — from a sofa to a chair across the room. If a character was going away from you, you had to follow him, or perhaps you were setting up a ',\n",
       "  'scene and needed a large panoramic shot on a crane. But for the most part, movement was kept to a minimum by the major directors. All that changed with! the introduction of zoom lenses and other sophisticated equipment, such as the crab dolly and its variations. Hitchcock sparked the invention of the crab dolly be\\xadcause of his demand for it; he wanted a camera that could not only dolly but could also move the way a crab moved — backward, forward, sideways and all the ways in be\\xadtween. With the sophisticated technical improvements, and particularly with the expansion of television and its new techniques, many directors arrived from film schools, where they had become proficient with the equipment. They had become so enamored of the zoom that it became a thing in itself after a while. It can dilute staging and staging skill and result in the actor being ignored. It reached its zenith with the directors of commercials, who are full of tricks because they have to be; they have thirty seconds to catch the eye of the audience with zooms, tricks, dissolves, fast pans and curious dollies. All this moved into story-telling from commercials, which it must be admitted, did produce some good directors, particular\\xadly in England; they come into pictures with a strong visual sense, but for the most part, the effect becomes an end in itself. In the final analysis, one must remember the director is the storyteller. He may not be the creator of it, but he is telling it, and it is his gifts as a storyteller that hold the audience. I remember Bertolt Brecht telling me, “Even a poem must have a story.” What distinguishes people in this business, one from another, is the story he or she has to tell. An actor walking on stage, whether it be theatre or film, should carry a story with him — a personal story. To the extent to which that story is attractive or unique is the extent to which an audience will be interested in him. John Ford always subscribed to the idea of telling a story and was very good at it. He used very little film; there are tales of his coming back after completing a day’s work and not having used up one reel of film. He’d got everything he’d wanted. Hitch would shoot a scene and say, “Cut — that’s all you need.” It was a phrase of his, when he had all he wanted; he was seeing it as a piece of the story. Renoir said, later, that the most important ele\\xadment is the actor and what he is doing. What is impor\\xadtant is what is happening in front of the camera and not behind it. When directors became enamored of the tech\\xadnical razzle-dazzle they became enamored with what was happening behind the camera, not in front of it. I think this is being tempered again. We are seeing simple, good camera work, and beautiful lighting and a great sense of visual strength. After Saboteur, I left California; I would have loved to have stayed and to this day I don’t know if I did the right thing. Peggy ',\n",
       "  'had remained in New York with our daughter, who was age two. I could have brought them to Hollywood. My agent, the William Morris office, wanted me to go back to New York. I have always believed it was because they didn’t want another actor on their hands. It’s true I didn’t have the prospect of imme\\xaddiate work, and the picture was not due to come out until May, when it would open at Radio City Music Hall, so there would be a few months to wait. That would mean that the William Morris office would have to find me work to bridge that time, and it was in their interest, since I was not known as a picture actor but was known back on Broadway, to have me return there. PARKER: Why would William Morris want you to go back to the East Coast when you had just starred in a film under a major director? It doesn’t seem to be a smart move. LLOYD: I wish I could answer that; I can’t, not from a creative and positive point of view. From a negative point of view, as I explained, they were really interested in people who got immediate work or who were offered things immediately. They had no way of selling me until the picture came out. I always thought that if I had been in Hollywood when the picture was released, things might have been a little better. But I was in New York and nothing really happened as a result of Saboteur. I made the lists of best performances and a list of the ten future stars in the business in magazines, but I was not on the scene to take advantage of it. There was another element: in those days, Broadway was the thing. I was a New Yorker — an actor, and New York was my city. I was raised there. Those of us who were serious actors, and I believed myself a serious actor, were truly committed to being New York actors — Broad\\xadway actors. We had an inner confusion; we all really wanted to go out and do Hollywood movies. We all really wanted to be picture stars. We would never admit it to anyone, be\\xadcause we also wanted to be artists in the theatre — to be in the Mercury, the Group, the Federal Theatre— and later on I did the first production, as a co-director and actor, with the Phoenix. In 1942, one felt curiously guilty about not working in the theatre. On the other hand, I was terribly drawn to staying in Hollywood. For one thing, I was a good tennis player, and tennis was not so common as it is now. While play\\xading tennis at the homes of people in the business, I thought, “What a marvelous way to live, with tennis courts and swimming pools.” Back at 123rd Street around Morningside Drive it was dreary. I returned and did a few undistinguished plays, among them a musical for the CIO called Marching with Johnny. It was directed by Phil Loeb. Zero Mostel was around, because he was a friend of both Phil’s and mine. I didn’t want to do many of the comedy sketches; I at\\xadtempted to get Zero to do them. While we were trying it out in Newark, he kept saying, “This stuff is so f',\n",
       "  'unny, Norman, you’re all wrong about it.” Phil Loeb said the same thing. Finally, I quit. I said to Zero, “If it’s so funny, you do it.” Zero said, “Oh, no. It’s no good.” Phil finally went into the show himself, because he couldn’t find anyone else to do if; they went on to Philadelphia, where they closed. It was typical of the shows I did in 1942 and 1943. Then in 1944 I got an offer from John Houseman, who was producing at Paramount Pictures, to come to Hol\\xadlywood to do a film called The Unseen, with Joel McCrea, Gail Russell and Herbert Marshall. It was a sequel to a successful ghost picture called The Uninvited with Ray Milland; Lewis Allen directed both of them. I had come out alone, while Peggy and Susanna stayed in New York When shooting was over, I decided to see if I could get work in Hollywood as an actor. A few weeks later, Hitchcock offered me a part, in Spellbound. It was a scene early in the film, with Ingrid Bergman; it established her as a psychiatrist, and I would be her first patient. Hitchcock wanted a certain quality, though it was a very small part; today if would be called a cameo. It was an honor to do it for him; I enjoyed it, and I played in the first scene that Hitchcock ever directed with Ingrid. Ingrid was a woman of great strength and charm. I worked with her later, over a longer period of time, on Arch of Triumph as Lewis Milestone’s associate. At the time of Spellbound, she was still rising to the top of her profession. She was a very well-known actress and was about to become the top star in the business. She was under contract to Selznick, as was Hitchcock; Selznick was making Spellbound. Hitch laid out this first scene in a certain way, though Ingrid had other ideas — something to do with the move\\xadment, I think; it was not to do with character or inter\\xadpretation. But Flitch had a definite concept of the shot and I assume that what Ingrid wanted would have altered it. Hitch, having made up his mind, would not alter any\\xadthing — that was not his way. He had a great sense of himself and he was a vain man; he wasn’t going to change a shot because an actor or actress had something else in mind. It was certainly true then, and perhaps to a certain ex\\xadtent it still is, that the director had to give off an air of in\\xadfallibility. Today, there is a little more give and take, though we still have directors who are God figures. Then, directors ruled by fear, by command, by their posi\\xadtion. With John Ford, you took your life in your hands if you suggested anything. Betty Field once told me that when she did Cheyenne Autumn with Ford, she made a suggestion about what kind of dress she would wear. It was just an ordinary house dress. He said, “You really think so?” On the set, he always addressed her as “the wardrobe mistress,” because she had the effrontery to suggest what she would wear. Source: Stages: Norman Lloyd.

       " ['STARLOG INTERVIEW Director of “Dune” The filmmaker who tamed “The Elephant Man” undertakes the grandest vision of them all—the realization on the screen of the epic universe created by Frank Herbert. by Paul Mandell Churubusco Studios in Mexico City wasn’t the same after the Dune company moved in. For one thing, the commissary cuisine had changed. Tacos and hard coffee made way for spinach pastas and fragrant cappuchinos, one of the many continental influences of producer Raffaella De Laurentiis. But the main course for the entire year was Dune. With eight stages needed to house an incredible 70 sets, Frank Herbert’s epic science-fiction saga has been realized after a decade of pitfalls. There’s the water-rich planet Caladan, where the foliage is rich and everything is green and brown and made of wood. Tiled floors recall Aztec and Venetian sensibilities, but the motifs on the bannisters and arch\\xadways are derivative of tire tracks. There are the deep purplish caves of the Fremen, and 50-foot sandworms which defy description. And there is the industrial wasteland of the oil planet Giedi Prime, a place where Dune’s avant-garde director David Lynch would undoubtedly feel right at home. Nattily attired in leather jacket, button- down white shirt, chino pants and dark glasses, Lynch talks with utter conviction. And, except for an occasional hushed snicker—as though he had told himself a better joke—there isn’t a clue as to whether or not he’s putting you on. Only one thing is certain: Lynch is one of the most original filmmakers the motion picture industry has ever seen. STARLOG: You’re known for your startling use of black and white photography. It’s hard to imagine Eraserhead and The Elephant Man in color. Yet, here you are in Mexico, directing a $50 million science- fiction movie in color. Do you see this as a black and white film? DAVID LYNCH: I would have ',\n",
       "  'loved to have made Dune in black and white, but it really is color film. I don’t feel bad about it. I would have loved to have seen some parts of Dune in black and white. Who knows? Maybe in some places, it may slip towards black and white; I might want to desaturate the color. Black and white takes you kind of far away. Some things are said better in it, some feelings come across better. STARLOG: Your cameraman, Freddie Francis, says you think in black and white. LYNCH: Freddie says I do? I have tb think of something to say about him. STARLOG: You seem to be obsessed with industrial images. Eraserhead was kind of a Freudian-industrial nightmare. The Elephant Man had many of those elements in a peripheral sense. LYNCH: Much of that is in Dune. I love industry. Pipes. I love fluid and smoke. I love man-made things. I love the machines that make the things. I like to see people hard at work, and I like to see sludge and man-made waste. I don’t know’ why. I like to see what nature does to it, and to see man-made things juxtaposed with nature. STARLOG: The generator machines in Dune look like tubular monsters. LYNCH: Yeah, well, there are many things in Dune that are very pleasing to me, but it’s not an industrial film. Giedi-Prime is one of the planets in Dune, and that, to me, is more of an industrial planet. It’s like a planet of black oil, steel and porcelain. But it’s different from an American factory. STARLOG: How did you begin to write the screenplay? The book is extremely complicated. LYNCH: Everyone finds it hard to get into the first 60 pages. But after that, it begins to work on you. Because it’s such a long book, the problems are inherent—you try to be true to the book, but you still lose stuff. The things you lose are the key to everything, and what you do with what’s left to make it cinematic is another thing. Sometimes, cinema works real well f',\n",
       "  'or condensing words. One line of Frank Herbert’s would make a whole bunch of images. I just went by feelings. Once I started working on my own, I wrote seven drafts. The only people who saw them were Dino and Raffaella De Laurentiis. The only problem with my earlier drafts w’as length. Clarity. Sometimes, I went off more into dreams and strange things, but now there’s a balance. To me, it’s true to Frank Herbert. It’s not the book, but it’s true to it. It took me a year-and- a-half to write it, and I’ve been fiddling with it since then. STARLOG: How were you approached for Dune? LYNCH: Dino’s office called me and asked if I had ever read Dune. I thought they said “June.” I never read either one of ’em! But once I got the book, it’s like when you hear a new word. And I started hearing it more often. Then, I began finding out that friends of mine had already read it and freaked out over it. It took me a long time to read. Actually, my wife forced me to read it. I wasn’t that keen on it at first, especially the first 60 pages. But the more I read, the more I liked. Because Dune has so many things that I like, I said, “This is a book that can be made into a film.” I became real excited about it and had a couple of meetings with Dino. His main reason for hiring me, really, was The Elephant Man. He wanted a science-fiction film that was about people, not about a bunch of space machines. I had many things inside me that Dino really didn’t know about. I like machines, I like space, I like dreams. Dino had never seen Eraserhead. In fact, he hates Eraserhead. It’s not his cup of tea, whereas Mel Brooks freaked out over it. So, I’ve been lucky that producers have liked the last thing I did, and in that I can grow and show more things in each successive project. STARLOG: Did you try to bring the oddball eccentricity of Eraserhead to Dune?  LYNCH: This film will be PG,',\n",
       "  ' for one thing, and that ties you quite a bit. You can think of some strange things to do, but as soon as they throw in PG, many go out the window. I like to go off the track. I haven’t really been able to do that here. But there are still many things in the film that are strange and exciting. We haven’t started doing montages. There’s gonna be a lot of that in Dune. Right now, I hope that I’ll have time in post\\xadproduction to experiment and fiddle around, because we’ve got some really good raw material. But it needs these special things. The biggest problem we still have is length. I know we will have a very long rough cut of Dune. So, we’re not out of the woods yet. STARLOG: What do you want those montages to be like? LYNCH: I don’t even really know what’s going to be in them. There are some images that I want to work with. I can picture things in my mind. But it’s not the same as when you have the film right in front of you. Sometimes in fiddling around, by accident, the problem opens up, and it just leads to the solution to everything. STARLOG: What attracts you to objects in decay? That’s a recurrent theme in your films so far. LYNCH: Well, if you set a piece of steel out in a vacant lot—at first, the steel could be kind of nice, but it’s sort of a “slow” area. Then, nature starts going to work on it. Pretty soon, the steel becomes a fantastic thing! It’s like smoke coming out of a chimney. A new chimney is one thing, but an old chimney—it’s years of heat, black smoke and hairs that catch in there and build up, right? And the side of the building’s all black with all these broken windows, and rotting grass is caught in there. It’s fantastic stuff! And you never could get it without nature and man both working together. STARLOG: Why are you generally against making movies in color? LYNCH: I’m not. When you see Dune, I don’t think you’ll say that this gu',\n",
       "  'y had difficulty in color. It’s just that black and white is so pure. And because it’s pure, everything is heightened in a way. It just has more power. Then, you have to have black and white sound to go with it, which is a tricky thing. Sound is so important to me. The w hole picture now is sort of dry. It gets much more real with sound, especially with sound effects. That’s why I can’t wait to get to work with Alan Splet again and get the right sound for these pictures. He did all the stuff for Eraserhead and Elephant Man. There’s no real technique that we can talk about; the only thing that we decide on is that “picture dictates sound.” It’s finding the sound that paints the right mood, and off you go to the next one. Right now, Alan has about 180 reels of sound effects. Every time I hear sounds, I see pictures. Then, I start getting ideas. It just drives me crazy. STARLOG: There was a rehearsal over on stage 5 with Carlo Rambaldi’s insect-like monstrosity, the Guild-Navigator. Was that image in the novel, or did you create it yourself? LYNCH: The Guild Navigator was “sort of” described. I\\xa0had another picture of the craft in my mind, like a fleshy grasshopper. STARLOG: How do you work with Rambaldi and Art Director Tony Masters? Who actually conceptualizes it on paper? LYNCH: I did one drawing first, and then Tony took over. I do many drawings, but they have a habit of getting lost, or they’re not very good. I feel funny about that. When I’m working on a film, it’s their job to draw, right? So, I just draw something that I want, and Tony takes it from there. He shows it to me and we work it out so we’re happy with it. Then, the drawing goes to Carlo. I made several trips to Rambaldi’s studio. He even let me fiddle with the clay for awhile. So, now he has built a fetus, a Navigator and different parts of the Sand-worms. It all contains the feeling of Fran',\n",
       "  'k Herbert’s original concepts. And that’s what’s so important. Because to me, ideas are where everything comes from. And you must be true to them. All the power — everything—is in that original idea. So, you can’t just go merrily off on your own. If you do that, you can’t call it Dune—you have to call it something else. STARLOG: How does it feel, going from Eraserhead which was made with no money, to Elephant Man, made with some money, to a $50 million movie—the most expensive project ever taken on by Universal? LYNCH: It doesn’t overwhelm me, because I don’t know about money. It’s not that I don’t care; I care about it a lot. But I don’t have to work with it the way Raffaella does. For her, $50 million is much more real than it is to me. I feel a responsibility to Dino and Raffaella, not to screw around and waste money. But I don’t ever see any money. I don’t have to hire and fire people. I just worry about what goes on film… and getting up in the morning. There are two things going here. I have to please more people than just myself. On Eraserhead, I only had to please myself. On Elephant Man and Dune, I had to please other people as well as myself. It would be wrong to compromise and say, “Well, I’m going to please this person half-way and myself half-way.” You have to sometimes find completely different solutions to the problems, so that you get all excited again. That’s why Dino and I have gotten along. Everytime he has had a problem, instead of compromising, I would think of another idea. Then, he becomes happy, because he sees I’m playing ball. I’m thinking with him in mind, but I’m also trying to think of a solution that doesn’t kill something. I know that this film will be a certain way, and all the ideas are not going to be mine. So, I must accept other people’s ideas, and that’s tricky. STARLOG: Directing Blade Runner would have been a natural f',\n",
       "  'or you. LYNCH: Well, when I heard about Blade Runner, I thought that I should be doing the film. I identified with it 100%. I know that people who worked on it had seen Eraserhead. But I was really disappointed in the over-all movie. I was expecting so much, and I don’t really know exactly what went wrong. You see, for some things, too much ruins it, and for other things, not enough ruins it. In Blade Runner, it was a matter of not being enough of a storyline. Most of the images, though, were totally beautiful. STARLOG: Just what is Ronnie Rocket? LYNCH: Ronnie Rocket is the movie I’d like to do next, if I get the chance. It’s about a three-foot tall guy with red hair and physical problems, and about 60-cycle alternating current electricity. STARLOG: Is it easy to lose contact with human emotion in a film like Dune, with so much bizarre technology? LYNCH: Not really. The technology is shot at a different time than the live action. In the beginning, all our scenes were between people in rooms. One or two humans interacting with other humans, and that was it. The technology was woven around all these human reactions. In a film like Star Wars, there’s much more dependence on special effects, and the human part suffers. They don’t care about it that much; it works for what it is. Dune is not quite the same thing. STARLOG: Jack Nance, who played Eraserhead has a bit part in Dune. LYNCH: Yeah. He plays a character called Nefed. He calls himself “Nerferd.” STARLOG: Do you enjoy working with actors? LYNCH: I love working with actors. It’s just like anything else; it’s the communication. What you do is have a rehearsal, cold. That’s usually the worst something will ever be. But now you have a point of departure. So, you start talking until you get somewhere. And then you shoot. And it’s as simple as that. Sometimes, you can get real magic from something that just w',\n",
       "  'asn’t working at all.The people in Dune do so many different things; they’re not one-note actors. I guess it’s like playing a real good violin. You can go way up. We’ve had some good experiences on Dune. And I never thought I would like to work with actors. I found out that I really loved it. STARLOG: Left to your own devices, what would you do when you’re not making a movie? LYNCH: I’m a shed builder. If I was just left alone, I would build sheds. I would plan them at Bob’s Big Boy Coffee Shop, and I would become very excited with these coffees and a chocolate shake. So, when I left Bob’s, I would be racing home with plans for certain parts of a shed, right? Then, I would find the right kind of wood and I would start cutting them up with my power saw, nailing it, fitting it and working it. And I would be almost in heaven with happiness. That is very nifty to me. Painting sometimes gets that way…. STARLOG: Do you think of yourself as a failed artist? LYNCH: In a way. You see, as long as I’m drawing, I feel as though I’m an artist. And I love the art life. I believe in the art life 100%. In the art life, there are rules—and I’ve broken many of’em. In a way, the art life was Henry in Eraserhead. If Henry was a painter, he would be perfect. He doesn’t have any friends. He can be by himself, right? You live by yourself, go into yourself and capture ideas, or you do whatever you do, but you must think. You have to get all set up to capture an idea, and it takes time. So, you must have time to think all by yourself, you can’t have your TV going. And you must be in an environment that’s inspiring to you—like in Philadelphia in a hotel room. And you get a mood and you start capturing ideas. STARLOG: Freddie Francis. He photographed and directed many English horror films. Yet, you picked him as your cameraman on Elephant Man and Dune because you had seen his work i',\n",
       "  'n Sons and Lovers. LYNCH: That’s right. Not only was it a great film, but it had a great black and white look. It seemed only natural to hire Freddie. I looked at other works by British directors of photography, and to me, they just didn’t come anywhere near what Freddie was doing. Sons and Lovers could have been about anything, but the photography was about light and dark, and a mood, and Freddie got it. It’s a D.H. Lawrence “factory” film, and it had many images in it that I love, and it was shot the way I love. STARLOG: You feel closer to the ’50s than any other decade, don’t you? LYNCH: Absolutely. The ’50s are just about it for me. I like the Beatles, but once they came in, everything changed in an OK way. I prefer the pre-Beatles era, even back to the ’20s. From the ’20s up to 1958, or maybe 1963, are my favorite years. Anything that happens in there I would find moods that I would just totally love. The ’70s, to me, were about the worst! There can be things in the ’80s that I love—high-tech things, NewWave things which echo the ’50s. But the ’70s—it just seems to be totally like leather and hair. There’s nothing there. The ’50s is “closer to the original idea” of what rock and roll is. So, there’s power in that original idea. STARLOG: Are you hung up on rock ’n’ roll? LYNCH: I like early Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino. I like all these, like, girl groups: the Ronnettes, the Chiffons and the Marvelettes. I like “Mr. Postman” and Little Richard’s “Bebopaloobop. ” This is the Ron\\xadnie Rocket thing, but it’s strange, “twisted” ’50s. STARLOG: Mexico is a pretty strange place, too. Rich in architecture and many incongruities. Were you able to get a bit of the Mexican influence into Dune? LYNCH: There might be some, but what influenced Dune most of all was Venice, Italy. I was brought to Italy by Dino. Raffaella and I went to a script conferenc',\n",
       "  'e with him in this place called Abano in Northern Italy, an hour and 15 minutes’ drive to Venice. We piled into the car and went into Venice. Dino got this gondola and dragged us to a certain spot, let us get out, walked down and saw St. Mark’s Piazza. It was a powerful experience. I had been working with Tony Masters. We were really researching books for different things. When I went into this cathedral, I just went nutty, there was marble like you had never seen, and shapes. Then, Dino bought me this book. I brought it back and started poring through it for ideas and inspiration. It was a point of departure. We kept going and going from there. It was architecture, painting, sculpture, this combined with this, turned upside down. In the way Al Splet and I were working with sounds,Tony Masters and I were using pictures—as inspiration. Much of it came from Venice. STARLOG: Did you find yourself wrestling with having to tone a scene down, make it less bright? LYNCH: As I said, I don’t like a dark film, but I like mood and I like contrast. So, some things should be dark, especially when things get strange. But I like light things, too. Arakis is one of the hottest planets in the universe, so it must be bright in some places, really bright. My tendency is to make things too dark. STARLOG: The 50 million dollar film that no one will see… LYNCH: Yeah, right. Many times I’m not arguing with Freddie, I’m begging him to make it darker. Dino, on the other hand, is begging him not to listen to me and make it lighter. I think Freddie is afraid that so much of Dune is lit in such a low key, no one will see the images. But it’s not that way. There s plenty of stuff to look at. Wait and see! Paul Mandell, NY-based freelancer, has reported for American Cinematographer, Cinefex and Fangoria.

       " ['by Jon Burlingame and Gary Crowdus Ennio Morricone occupies a unique place in the history of twentieth-century music. He is without question one of the world’s most successful, and brilliant, composers for film, although he continues to write surprising music for the concert hall as well. The prolific. Italian-born composer first came to worldwide prominence\\xa0as a result of his collaboration with director Sergio Leone on a trilogy of Clint Eastwood movies: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). His unique approach to those now-classic Westerns—including offbeat vocal effects and orchestrations that ranged from the traditionally\\xa0symphonic to the bizarre—launched a career that has few, if any, parallels in the history of movie music. Born in Rome in 1928, Morricone studied composition with Goffre\\xaddo Petrassi at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia. He worked as an arranger from the late Fifties through the mid Sixties, with such performers\\xa0as Mario Lanza, Paul Anka, Charles Aznavour, and Gianni Morandi. His first film assignment came in 1961 (Il federale, by director Luciano Salce, with whom Morricone had worked in the Italian theater). In addition to Leone, Morricone began to work with some of the greatest directors of European cinema, among them Pier Paolo Pasolini (Uccellacci e Uccellini, 1965, and Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom, 1975); Mauro Bolognini (L’Assoluto Naturale, 1969, and Metello, 1970); Elio Petri (Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion, 1969); Gillo Pontecorvo (The Battle of Algiers, 1965, and Burn!, 1969); Henri Verneuil (The Sicilian Clan, 1969, and The Burglars, 1971); Giuliano Montaldo (Sacco and Vanzetti, 1971); and Bernardo Bertolucci (1900, 1976). Morricone remained the composer of choice for Sergio Leone. His scores for the director’s Once Upon a Time in the West (1969), Duck, You Sucker (1971) and Once Upon a Time in America (1984) and, with Leone as producer, My Name Is Nobody (1973), were remarkable\\xa0for their inventiveness and color. He wrote more than just Westerns, however. Morricone found scripts for police action films, psychological dramas, comedies, historical epics, and romances piling up at his door. Among the American and British directors who engaged him with high-profile projects were Don Siegel (Two Mules for Sister Sara, 1970), John Boorman (Exorcist II: The Heretic, 1977), Terence Malick (Days of Heaven, 1978), Richard Fleischer (Red Sonja, 1985) and William Friedkin (Rampage, 1987). Still, despite the huge international recording success of his The Good, the Bad and the Ugly theme, the composer was not widely-known in the United States except to film buffs and an ever-growing audience of soundtrack-album collectors. That long-overdue recognition came with Morricone’s universally admired, orchestral-and-choral score for the Roland Joffe epic The Mission (1986). It brought him one of his four Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score. He had previously been nominated for Malick’s Days of Heaven; later nominations were accorded him for Brian DePalma’s The Untouch\\xadables (1987) and Barry Levinson’s Bugsy (1991).',\n",
       "  ' Other major Morricone scores since The Mission have included Roman Polanski’s Frantic (1988), DePalma’s Casualties of War (1989), Franco Zeffirelli’s Hamlet (1990), Pedro Almodovar’s Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990), Joffe’s City of Joy (1992), Wolfgang Petersen’s In the Line of Fire (1993) and Mike Nichols’s Wolf (1994). A particular favorite among moviegoers worldwide is Giuseppe Tornatore’s Cinema Paradiso (1988), winner of the Best Foreign Film Oscar. In addition to his estimated four hundred motion picture scores, Morricone has composed equally memorable music for such acclaimed TV miniseries as Moses the lawgiver (1975) and Marco Polo (1982) and a number of television films including Secret of the Sahara (1987). Bryan Forbes’s The Endless Game (1989) and four of the La Piovra films for European television (1985-1990). His “Chi mai,” the theme from Jerzy Kawalerowicz’s Maddalena (1971), became an international\\xa0hit after its use in the BBC series The Life and Times of David Uoyd George (1981). Morricone’s four Oscar nominations are but a handful of the awards he has received. The British Academy of Film & Television Arts has honored him four times; he has received a Golden Globe (for The Mission.) and a Grammy (for The Untouchables.), more than two dozen gold albums and five platinum ones; five of the prestigious Nastri d’Argento; four David di Donatello awards; and countless other honors in his native Italy and around the world. Despite his fame in the film world, however, Morricone has also continued to write and perform music for the concert hall. His more than fifty compositions for the classical field include works for chamber groups, symphony orchestra, solo voice, and choral ensembles. Virgin Records has recorded several of his chamber pieces; he also is one of the prime movers behind the improvisation group Nuova Consonanza. Morricone was interviewed for Cineaste in two separate sessions: in Los Angeles in March 1994 by Jon Burlingame, when the composer received a Career Achievement Award from The Society for the Preservation\\xa0of Film Music, and the following month in New York by Cineaste Editor Gary Crowdus. Simultaneous translation was provided, respectively, by Lena Erin and Vivian Treves. —Jon Burlingame * * * Cineaste: Critics in this country don’t take film music seriously. Do you consider film music as valid a form as chamber music, symphonic writing, or opera? Ennio Morricone: Film music is not at the same level as classical or chamber music because those compositions are born naturally from the composer himself. The composition expresses itself without any conditions or limitations. In the cinema, the music is conditioned by the images and by the direction of the director, and therefore is complementary to the film. This does not mean that film music is not worthwhile. It always depends on who’s writing it. It’s not seriously considered because there is a grave infiltration, throughout the entire world, including America, of amateurs and dilettantes, people who do not know music. Therefore, this lowers the level of the profession, and film music is not considered a serious art form. Cineaste: What ',\n",
       "  'control, if any. do you have over the use of your music in a film once you’ve delivered it to the producer or the director. For example, some influential directors contractually negotiate for the right of final cut. Is it not possible for a composer of your international stature and reputation to insist on some level of creative control? For example, how often are you able to participate in the final mix? Morricone: This is the first time I’ve ever been asked this question. You have to remember that the director is the principal creative force in the making of the film. I have sometimes been involved in the shifting of the music from one point to another in the film—it’s good for the film and it’s good for the music, it makes the music even better. On the other hand, when a respectable director shifts the music, he does it with the musician. I’ve always worked with directors like that. And usually, because most of them were quite musical, they’ve always given me rather logical advice. Many times after I do the recording I’ll give them the same kind of suggestions, that they should shift the music here or there. Since the relationship between a director and a composer is one of faith, of trust, this happens with no trauma. However, you have to remember what I said at the beginning, OK? The director is the sole author of the complete cinematic work, even if the author of the music is an important collaborator and creator, and one of the few collaborators the director is not able to control completely. Notwithstanding this, I do not believe that the director should accept a contractual clause whereby he is constrained by the composer’s decisions. Cineaste: How often has the score that you’ve written and recorded been dubbed into the picture to your satisfaction? Morricone: Almost always. What doesn’t satisfy me is that you don’t always hear the music as much as I would like. Cineaste: Dots that happen often? Morricone: Sometimes. Cineaste: Can you exercise any control over that aspect?  Morricone: I give general opinions to the directors. I tell them that a human being cannot decipher more than two different levels of sound at the same time—I’m not speaking of music. Physically, the brain cannot receive more than two sounds at a time. If a director mixes in the general sound column the dialog and the sound effects as well as the music, the human ear cannot distinguish the music. What one hears is a very confused kind of noise. It would be wonderful if the music had only one more element combined with it. I recommend this to the directors. Not so much for me, but for the clarity of the film, so that the public will understand it. But I can only suggest this to the director. Anything more would seem as if I were thinking only of myself and not of the film. Cineaste: How do you deal with directors, notably Gillo Pontecorvo. who have some knowledge of music and sometimes want to contribute their own themes? Morricone: With Pontecorvo, I have a good rapport. Among directors, he is one of my best friends. Therefore, when he says something I don’t like, I tell him very clearly. And I must say that he respects my opinions. Cine',\n",
       "  'aste: Do you prefer to have detailed discussions with a film’s director about the type of score he may be looking for, or would you prefer simply to be left to your own devices? Morricone: When a director calls me, he already knows what I can give him. so he recognizes in me a certain homogenity of ideas. I then have to reflect freely on the project so that I can make some proposals to him. After I’ve made my proposals, we have a discussion. He can then add his ideas, or correct mine, and that’s where the discussion takes place. Sometimes our discussion ends right away, because we agree immediately. Sometimes I have to convince the director that 1 don’t like his idea, or he has to convince me that he doesn’t like my idea, and sometimes we find a compromise. Cineaste: For most films, does an audience need a melody to hear and retain? And, if so, does that limit your creative choices? Morricone: When it is necessary, it is good to have a melodic theme. But when do we do them? This is the problem. The public and many times even the director demand a melody, especially when there are some very expressive scenes that require it. This does not mean that we cannot do a film without a melody, but the public seems to expect a melodic line every time there is an expression of sentimentality. Personally, I can do without a melodic theme. In fact, in many cases I have tried to disguise the melodic theme within rests, pauses, and silence, and to encourage the public to identify those sentimental sensations with musical colors instead of a theme. Unfortunately, even though I’ve conducted many experiments along these lines, the public still wants to hear a melody. Cineaste: Why do you always orchestrate your own scores? Do you believe that composers who do not orchestrate are shortchanging either the music or the film? Morricone: I don’t want to get into delicate professional questions. However, I will make a simple declaration. Composers in all epochs and all ages, except perhaps this one, for film and other contemporary musical practices, have always written out their own music. I cannot understand why one who calls himself a composer does not finish his own music, and thereby give the final and definitive touch to his composition. This stems from the era of musical theater, where composers hired arrangers to write out the music because either they did not know how, or were too lazy, or because of the excessive workload. Throughout the history of music, no composer has had his score written out by someone else. So why does this occur in film music? I do not understand. Cineaste: Would you comment on your use of unusual sound choices—such as whistling, vocal or electronic effects—notably in the early films with Sergio Leone?  Morricone: Many believe that those were special effects. They seemed to be right, however, and therefore I put them in. After all, whistling comes out of the human body and is like the voice; it is not a special effect. In fact, it is a sound between the voice and the flute, or perhaps the piccolo. And since it comes out of the body, it is a very natural sound. I do not believe I have used any special kinds o',\n",
       "  'f instruments—except, in certain cases, the church organ, which, since nobody else had used it. was probably considered a special effect. Cineaste: You use the human voice, both solo and in choruses, far more than most composers. Why? Is it a humanizing touch for music that might otherwise seem cool? Morricone: The human voice is at the disposal of all composers. Why don’t others use it? I love the human voice, because it is an extraordinary instrument. It doesn’t go through a piece of wood or metal, it comes directly out of the body and can be the most expressive and malleable instrument. It can react in many strange ways. First, I used the human voice because I love it; and second, I used it because I had an exceptional voice at my disposal. [He alludes to Edda Dell’Orso, whose remarkable voice can be heard in several of the Leone films and other Morricone scores—ed.] And during the period we are referring to, I used that particular voice often because I really liked it. So I became known as someone who uses the human voice all the time. Perhaps it’s true, but everyone can use the voice. It’s at every composer’s disposal. Cineaste: You have been known to incorporate references to classical works, including Mozart and Beethoven, in some of your scores. Is this a matter of making the music fun, either for you or for your more musically knowledgeable listeners? Morricone: I have made some very brief references at times. They are only brief references, as if for a moment you become very eccentric, but it’s not as if it was necessary or important to the piece at hand. I wanted to do it because it was fun. And I’ve always done it when I’ve composed a piece in collage form. At a certain point. I just throw in a reference—for example, a bit of Mozart—which is a minute piece of the composition. It works as a whole for the reason that the composition itself is not a homogeneous piece. Cineaste: It’s said that today you turn down more than half of the film projects offered to you. What criteria do you use in deciding which projects to accept? Morricone: If I like the director, if I have esteem for him. that helps me to decide. And if it’s a director I’ve worked with before, and worked well with, this is a preference. I never decide after having seen a film, I decide before because professionally it’s not correct to assume a critical position to accept or refuse after having seen the work. Besides, when I see a film it’s not finished yet, so it doesn’t have all of its elements. Therefore, my refusals are really for works that I cannot do simply because I don’t have the time. Since I do all my own orchestrations—I have no help, I don’t want and have never had anybody else’s help—I have very limited time to complete work. Therefore I have to analyze my time. Cineaste: When choosing your films, is the subject matter also important, or the prospect of solving interesting dramatic problems with music? Morricone: Both of those considerations are important, but I must also explain that, for me, writing music is a very joyous experience. I love writing music and, therefore, I love this profession. More than anything, the selection is ',\n",
       "  'guided by this love to write. In addition, there is the joy of surmounting the difficulties and those requests made by the director. Tackling these requests, even though they are sometimes strange, offers the greatest satisfaction once achieved. One of the pleasures of this profession, in fact, is to address and meet the conditions set by the director. Cineaste: Once you’ve chosen a project, do you write music based on an emotional reaction to the visuals, or is it more of an intellectual exercise? Morricone: Both things, absolutely. The composer must let himself go, as a member of the public, not as a critic, and must be guided by his emotions. After this, he intervenes technically and therefore also intellectually, as well as with his artistic abilities. First, however, he must let himself go, and. then, on the wave of letting go, react to the images, and then he responds in a musically expressive manner. Cineaste: What is the average length of time you are given to write and record a film score? A common complaint among many film composers is that they could write better scores if they had more time. Do you agree with that or do you find the pressure of a short schedule to be a creative stimulant? Morricone: In asking the question you’ve already answered everything. Usually they give me the time I need. I never had to complain about too short a schedule because I always ask for the time I need. Cineaste: How much time is that? Morricone: Usually a month and a half, and they give it to me because they know I need it. When I didn’t have the time I needed, the score that I wrote in a very short time was not better than the one that I had four months to write. Cineaste: Was it worse? Morricone: In taking four or five months to write the music for a film, a composer could produce an excessive elaboration, an involution, in a sense, so that the result would be much less spontaneous. You have to remember that, for a film, the work has to be precise and directed toward the spectator, so too many mediations of resolution of a scientific and mathematical nature in the composition could be negative. With more time, then, the composer could be carried away with his taste for this elaboration and arrive at a composition that is perhaps on a slightly more superior level but one that is more difficult for the spectator. Enrico de Melis [friend of Morricone]: But there’s a very important factor you should talk about. Contrary to most other composers, directors ask you to write the scores for their films way ahead of time, when they’re writing the screenplay. Cineaste: So you’re asked very early on? Morricone: Yes, sometimes. It’s not that they ask me to write the score then, but to do the themes. I write the themes at the time the script is done. That’s not the same thing as writing a score. Cineaste: How often do you compose before seeing a final cut? Morricone: Almost always, because when I view the film it is not in its final form. Therefore, corrections to the score are usually made after the final cut has been made. Cineaste: Can you discuss the sources of your artistic inspiration, or describe the process of how you create ',\n",
       "  'such beautiful and emotionally powerful music? To avoid seeming overly mystical about this matter, and to refer to that old cliché, how much of your work derives from perspiration—that is, from hard work and years of training and experience—and how much derives from inspiration? There’s this romantic notion that the composer sits and waits for the muse to strike, after which melodies flow from his pen. But it’s actually very hard work, isn’t it? Morricone: It’s definitely a cliché. Music does not descend from the skies. I think most of it is work—sweat and application—combined with our personal influences, of the artistic experiences which have formed us, and our musical experiences, both historical ones and those particular to film. Let’s say that the general result, whether from inspiration or technical preparation, comes through many interactions between various components, and all these influences determine the final product. Cineaste: You are probably most widely known for your early scores for the Sergio Leone Westerns. Most people are unaware, however, that many of those scores were written before the filming was done. That’s a complete reversal of the usual production procedure. Leone said, in fact, that for those films the music was as important as the dialog.  Morricone: Leone first called me because he had heard my music for two other Italian-Spanish Westerns. He’d heard an arrangement I’d done for a song, and he wanted that arrangement for A Fistful of Dollars. It was an atmosphere to which we later added the theme, and the whistle, and so on. Then, in the following films, Leone granted a greater importance to the use of the music than most other directors. For him. music really was as important as dialog and all the other components. Therefore, he felt it was important to ask me to write the music before he shot the film. Cineaste: I’ve heard he actually filmed scenes as the music was played?  Morricone: Yes. He had a recording of an arrangement of the music which he played on the set. Cineaste: Do you find that, as with Leone. European directors are more willing than American directors to let the music assume a more prominent role? Morricone: No, not at all. I do not think that Leone gave more possibilities to work within the film than other directors. It stems primarily from Leone’s style, which allowed more time, more space, for music than that of other directors. It wasn’t because of our friendship; it was strictly his particular style. For Leone, music was a very dramatic and expressive element, and, because of this, he allowed the right amount of time and space for music. If other directors do not do this, that’s OK. Again, it depends upon the personal style of the director. Cineaste: Your collaborations with Leone had an enormous impact on world cinema and on film music. Did you recognize it at the time and how do you assess their impact now? Morricone: As I said before, Leone allowed a lot more time and space for music; that was his stylistic choice. And since there was more music, people heard more music. And if they heard more music, they noticed it more. And if they noticed it more, they were ',\n",
       "  'able to assimilate it more. This is a sign that is very important to a composer, because now he finds himself collaborating on a more intense level and his music becomes an integral part of the film itself. I will make a very simple, paradoxical statement. If a director gives a composer ten seconds of time, he cannot be heard and therefore cannot collaborate with the director. However, if a director gives ten minutes of time, the composer can express himself properly. If the ten minutes that you have been given can be heard, and it is not drowned out by either the dialog between the characters or the special effects and action—which distracts the public from the music —then the music will be appreciated. However, if in those ten minutes you cannot even begin to hear any musical expression, because of the dialog or action taking place at the same time, the music is completely destroyed. Therefore, ten seconds of music, if it can be heard, is a far better collaboration between director and composer than ten minutes of music which has been stifled by other factors within the film. The final decision of whether to hear the music or not remains in the hands of the director. If the director believes that the music serves a function as a dramatic and expressive form, then the music will be heard; if not, then it will not be heard. This is not a fault; we must always keep in mind Sergio Leone as the central character in this question. Cineaste: The Mission was a great favorite in this country. What was it about that film that inspired you, and can you speak about your choices, including the use of a choir and indigenous South American instruments? Morricone: I don’t know if The Mission was very well loved in America. I would have liked it if the film had been better received here. With regard to the music, there were many considerations. I was conditioned by the following things: the Jesuits, who were bringing their civilization and beliefs to South America, as well as the type of music they were accustomed to. The instruments they brought to teach to the Indians were instruments from Western Europe. This was the first condition. Second, one of the two protagonists played the oboe. That’s another condition. And the third condition was the music of the Indians themselves. Therefore, I had to take into account these facts, two of which were historical. The third fact was that the priest played an oboe. The oboe piece is influenced by the development and composition of Renaissance music. These were the things I had to keep in mind when writing the music for the Jesuits. There was a contrast between Renaissance music, the music created by the Indians themselves, and the oboe. These three elements, combined, gave the final result not only in a musical sense, but also in a historical sense, of the communion that existed between the Jesuits and the Indians. The result is that the music describes the spiritual union between the Jesuits and the Indians, both on a musical level—combining the styles of Western Europe, South America, and the indigenous music of the Indians—as well as on an expressive level. On a technical level, it was ',\n",
       "  'incredibly difficult. The musical concept was mine; the director did not ask me to do this. I feel very attached to this music. I recognize myself in this piece. Cineaste: How important is it, in your view, that a score for a historical film attempt to be authentic in terms of the use of original instruments or a re creation of the musical style of the era? For example, how extensive was your research for films such as Moses and Marco Polo, which involved ancient Jewish music and Oriental music. Morricone: In general, I don’t have the original instruments nor the people who can play them, and sometimes I don’t think I’m even interested in that regard. I use instruments which give the illusion of the instruments of the era, perhaps using them only for a little color, and I also use the technical composition of that period. In Marco Polo, for example. I wrote a piece with only two chords. Then there arc the Hebrew modalities, which I know well, and which are very close to the Greek ones, later acquired by the modalities of liturgical Christian music. Even today Gregorian chant is an emanation of the Greek and Hebrew, so all of this brought about the results of Moses and Marco Polo. Of course, in Marco Polo there was also the Chinese element, which was the result of the same idea. Cineaste: The version of Marco Polo that was shown on American television was shorter than that shown in Europe and the music seemed to be very badly mixed, even abused. Were you able to participate in the mixing of the American version of that film? Morricone: I came to Los Angeles to participate in the mixing of the music, and I was scandalized by how they treated the music. It was so…they should have been ashamed of themselves. I left before it was finished. In America they don’t care about the music on TV, all they care about is the dialog. Since they cut everything that was not dialog, they sacrificed my music in a terrible way. After that experience. I refused all TV work that would go on television in America. Cineaste: What about Abraham? Morricone: I didn’t do Abraham, I turned it down, all I did are the main titles and end titles. This is one of the reasons why I turned it down. I’m not against music on TV or in TV films. I am against how in America they pay attention only to dialog. It’s as if people didn’t want to lost time to hear the music. They reduced Marco Polo to a soap opera, and it’s not right. Not all TV programs are alike. A program of artistic merit, like Marco Polo, which has nothing to do with the usual commercial work, was reduced on American TV to a very low level of pure discussion between actors. It became merely a verbal account. Cineaste: Why do you think music is generally ignored in most film criticism? What for you would constitute good film music criticism?  Morricone Most film critics should not judge the music, it’s not their job, and, in general, when they do they usually come out very badly. They should talk in general about the film, its expressivity, and what the music is to the film, so that they judge the him in the totality of its elements. Sometimes a critic ventures to say that there’s too much mus',\n",
       "  'ic, or that it’s too loud, or that there’s too little music, or too much beautiful music, and when they want to talk about it they use a single adjective. That’s not criticism, really, about the music. Cineaste: Is the problem that film critics, in general, don’t have adequate musical training, and therefore the necessary critical tools, to comment authoritatively on the music? Morricone: It’s really not their job. They should judge the film in its entirety. A film is not a musical work. Cineaste: Some would argue that the sound, including the music, is sometimes as much as fifty percent of the overall cinematic experience, and that it would be a good thing if critics were able to comment more authoritatively on the music and sound. Morricone: Certainly, more attention to film music on the part of critics wouldn’t be a bad idea, it would be welcome. But you can’t ask for this. Cineaste: How important is it for you that your scores are released separately on CD? Morricone: Very important. Cineaste: Why? Morricone: Because sometimes the director finds it necessary to hold back the music and so it cannot really make the contribution it would have wanted to make. In that sense, a compact disc is a way for the composer to vindicate himself, to revalidate his music. The compact disc enables the audience to finally hear the music they couldn’t hear during the film. Cineaste: Do you have any personal favorite scores? Morricone: I never answer this question, because I like all the film music that I have composed. If at the end of a him there is some thing that I didn’t really like, it is because of the use of the music in the film, or its length, or the possibility that the public won’t hear it. I have always done my best. If my goal is sometimes not achieved, then it depends on the circumstances mentioned earlier. Cineaste: Do you have any plans for concerts in the U.S.? Morricone: I don’t know. It doesn’t necessarily depend on me. Then again, what kind of concerts? If they are film music concerts. I do not want to do those. I want to do non-film music, meaning more refined, difficult music. The public wants to hear film music, but I don’t want to give it to them. So when they go to the concert, they will be disillusioned by what they hear, because they will get something they did not expect. Cineaste: How do you presently divide your time between film music and concert music? Morricone: Fifty-fifty. Cineaste: Which is more satisfying to you as a composer? Morricone: They are two separate things. You must remember that film music is written to be at the service of the cinematic work, and so is conditioned by the film. My other music is not conditioned by anything else I am the one who decides my chamber music, so 1 am the artistic father of the concert music. In the cinema, the father of the work is the director. But writing film music also gives me great satisfaction, and I’m very happy that the film music I’ve written is widely heard. To confront the director and the public and to see that the music really works in the film is a source of great satisfaction in a spiritual sense as well. Cineaste, Vol. 21, No. 1/2 (1995), p'],\n",
       " ['by Leonard Quart Pauline Kael shook up the critical scene with her controversial\\xa01963 Film Quarterly article, “Circles and Squares,” which attacked auteurist critics for their attempts to promote hack Hollywood films as serious works of art. During the mid-Sixties, she freelanced, writing for McCalls’s, The New Republic, Sight and Sound, and Life, among other magazine. From 1968 on she wrote length critical\\xa0essays and reviews on film for The New Yorker, retiring in 1991. Today, at age eight-one, she lives alone in a handsome, book-filled, large stone-and-shingle house on the heights overlooking Great Barrington, a bustling, gentrified town in the Berkshires. For a number of years she has suffered from Parkinson’s, and can no longer write. Though she is fragile, and age and disease may have slowed her down, her passion for film and her intellectual combativeness, vitality, and independence remain intact. In her heyday Pauline Kael was arguably the most formidable and influential voice in American film criticism. She won a Guggenheim, and her fourth book, Deeper Into Movies (1973), was the first on film to win a National Book Award. She was perceived then as somebody with the power to make or break a film. It was her exultant reviews of films like Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde and Altman’s Nashville (e.g., “It’s a pure emotional high, and you don’t come down when the picture is over”) that made their critical reputations. Kael never permitted her readers to remain neutral—evoking either devotion or antipathy both from ordinary readers, directors, studios, and other critics. Her criticism was tendentious and at times outrageous, but never dull. One could find many of her critical judgments maddening, but her probing, idiosyncratic, and thoroughly original essays were always worth a careful reading. Her colloquial and pungent prose style was always both accessible and exhilarating—the work of a gifted writer who saw criticism as an art, and cared as much about the metaphors, witty barbs, and turns of phrase she used as about her critical\\xa0opinions. Kael had a disdain for theory, eschewing abstraction and critical objectivity for the primacy of her subjective, gut response to the actors, performances, sociological import, and directorial style of a film. She embraced kinetic, unsentimental films and directors given to expressionist\\xa0excess like Peckinpah, Scorsese, and De Palma, but had a harder time accepting more meditative and severe directors like Bresson. She had only contempt for big Hollywood movies like The Sound of Music (dubbing it “The Sound of Money”), liberal, middlebrow films like Coming Home, and for studio executives who “love to play God with other people’s creations“ and mangle them. At the same time, she loved popular entertainment for the pleasure it provided. But, unlike many film academics, she never pretentiously discovered hidden meanings in schlock or inflated its significance by comparing a film like Pretty Woman to a Shakespeare or Shaw play. Nobody coul',\n",
       "  'd ever call Kael’s critical responses schematic or programmed. She was always unpredictable,\\xa0and had the gift of capturing the nature of a film in a single sentence. Pauline Kael is a singular voice in the history of American film criticism. Cineaste interviewed Kael in the summer of 1999, discussing her critical career and early influences, her philosophy of criticism, great American films of the Seventies, her thoughts about retirement, and her provocative views on some recent American movies. Thanks to Jim Schlachter for transcribing the taped interview. —Leonard Quart * * * Cineaste: Who were your critical models? Pauline Kael: When I was a teenage philosophy student at Berkeley, my friends and I were devoted to James Agee because he was the only movie critic who spoke to us. He reacted to movies the way somebody smart, honest and knowledgeable would respond. Most of the other critics gave us blather about the virtues and defects of a movie, and all the good it was going to do. But he reacted emotionally and intellectually to what was on the screen, and we could recognize the feelings. When I began writing I cited Eastern critics (I was living on the West Coast then)—the best ones, such as Dwight Macdonald and Stanley Kauffmann—as examples of the mandarin solemnity that was sinking movie criticism. They didn’t react personally to what was on the screen; they filtered the movies through a set of ideas. I tried in most of my West Coast pieces to differentiate myself from them. People on the West Coast saw the movies then in terms of what the Eastern critics told them they should see, and often there were wonderful movies they didn’t pay attention to or rejected. Cineaste: Did you think that your emphasis on a personal voice demanded that you be as much a writer as a critic? Kael: Leslie Fiedler once said something like “A critic is an artist or he is nothing.” I’ve always thought of criticism as a branch of writing, and, if you don’t honor the readers enough to write your very damned best, you’re insulting them and you’re insulting the work you’re dealing with. Cineaste: Were there other critical models besides Agee? Kael: He was the dominant one for films. I felt an excitement reading Agee. Later, I also enjoyed reading Manny Farber—he’s an amazing man, and a friend—but I don’t feel a rapport with his responses to movie content. It’s his analysis of the film frame as if it were a painter’s canvas that’s a real contribution. I also read people who were critics for a brief period, or who had an unusual slant, like Cecilia Ager and Vachel Lindsay and Robert Warshow, and who sometimes did wonderful pieces on film. I was more influenced, though, by literary critics, such as R.P. Blackmur. But I think it was more my friends’ reactions and arguing with them about movies that got me interested—friends such as Robert Duncan, the poet, and another poet, Robert Horan. I had no intention of becoming a movie critic; that was a surprise. The law school at Berkeley accepted me, b',\n",
       "  'ut I got involved with Horan and lost interest. I started to write, and everything snapped together in my life when I wrote about movies. The pieces I submitted were accepted immediately, whereas my articles on books and other subjects interested editors, but I was told to try them again. Still, I didn’t get a position as a movie critic until I was close to fifty. I put an awful lot of energy into crappy jobs, but I couldn’t get a job as a critic. I did a movie review program on KPFA in Berkeley. and it got a lot of attention, but I didn’t get paid. The one related job I had was running twin Berkeley movie revival theaters for five years. Cineaste: What is your opinion of academic film theory and criticism? Kael: I think much of it is useless. I don’t understand how people get so far from common sense that they make difficulties where none exist. I tried to deal with some of that when I wrote about Kracauer’s theory of film back in 1962. Contemporary theorists—feminist and deconstructivist—seem even more obfuscatory. So often the theories that are promoted are a way for professors to show off and be idolized by their students. Once this giant cloak of theory is placed over the movie-viewing experience, the students are at the mercy of the teachers because they are told that nothing they have felt is relevant. It seems to me that the critic’s task should be to help people see more in the work than they might see without him. That’s a modest function, and you don’t need a big theory for it. Cineaste: What audience did you aim your criticism for, and did you ever tailor your criticism for The New Yorker’s educated, upper-middle-class audience? Kael: I didn’t aim it at any particular audience. Anybody who wants to read it, can. I wrote the same way for McCall’s as for The New Yorker, and I always tried to be as direct and plain as I could be. I got a terrific amount of mail at The New Yorker—an awful lot of it was from high school and college kids. You don’t expect New Yorker readers to be that young, and sometimes they live in the Midwest or the South and they may be the only people in their small town who get the magazine. They often said that I had made them feel they weren’t crazy— that they had read my criticism and it coincided with what they felt. When William Shawn first talked to me about writing for him I was dubious because of the swank look; the ads and the whole silky texture of the magazine was a real turn-off. I gradually talked myself into it, and was happy that I did. Cineaste: Do you see the rise of independent American film as a genuine alternative to Hollywood? Kael: Does that mean that Hollywood is the Great Satan? Generally, as soon as you make a successful independent film, Hollywood releases it anyway. What matters is that the movies reach an audience. I rather like Michael Almereyda’s films, but does it matter where he got the money? You’re always borrowing your money from someone. There have been good films, like Flirting with Disaster, Chasing A',\n",
       "  'my,\\xa0and One False Move. I’m not sure which you would consider independent. I love Vanya on 42nd Street. It was certainly a small production. But I also loved the MGM musical Pennies From Heaven, and I preferred Last of the Mohicans to Safe.  Cineaste: You have usually critically excoriated “middlebrow”\\xa0films like Chariots of Fire and liberal, well-meaning films like Coming Home. How did your New Yorker readers respond to those critiques? Kael: The angriest mail I got was from disliking Rain Man, because people felt I was somehow putting down autism. It’s the same problem I had when I said that Shoah was not a masterwork. They think you’re being insensitive about the Holocaust, even though they themselves may have seen the movie in a blind torpor of tears and suffering. There’s often a confusion in the audience’s mind between a movie’s message and the quality of the movie. Liberal moviegoers are so sweet on themselves, and liberal movies flatter them. I tried to make distinctions. For example, in Coming Home, the right-wing military officer was lousy in bed, and the mutilated boy wasn’t just a liberal fellow—he was also great in bed. It’s as if the liberals want to congratulate themselves in every possible way. The plot of a film like that is offensively convenient. It violates what you know about the world. The Front never came close to what we saw in the press, which was that the blacklisted writers looked like Woody Allen and the men who fronted for them looked handsome and distinguished. In the movie they reversed it. All I ask for is a little tough-mindedness. Can’t educated liberals see that a movie like American Beauty sucks up to them at every plot turn? Cineaste: If you dislike films that project a facile, sentimentally liberal perspective, what is your critical response to two genuinely left, sometimes politically heavy directors whom Cine\\xadaste often interviews —Ken Loach and John Sayles? Kael: I agree that they’re not facile, but their political content is heavy only in the sense of being often oppressive. Loach is no bundle of joy, and Sayles is a literal\\xad-minded director. His work is decent, intelligent, and filled with integrity, hut he doesn’t have a real instinct for making movies. There are kids who make movies when they’re twenty-five, who know nothing about anything else, but who have a flair for the medium. He doesn’t. But to go back: I didn’t dislike American Beauty—I hated it. It’s not that it’s badly made—it isn’t. It has snappy rhythms and Kevin Spacey’s line readings are very smart, and Annette Bening is skillful in the scene where she beats up on herself. But the picture is a con. It buries us under the same load of attitudes that were tried out in Car\\xadnal Knowledge and The Ice Storm, with the nice trustworthy young dope-dealers of Easy Rider. Maybe audiences are so familiar with this set of anti-suburbia attitudes that it’s developed into its own movie genre. Cineaste: Did you allow your political sympathies to intrude when dealing with right',\n",
       "  '-wing films like Don Siegel’s Dirty Harry? Kael: I don’t know what you mean by “intrude.” The movie was popular with people partly because of its right-wing attitude, but they didn’t necessarily recognize it as right wing. Certainly most of the press didn’t, not when it first came out. I felt it necessary to treat it as a political work because its politics offended me. Eastwood’s films are right wing in a way that doesn’t get analyzed because they’re not explicitly so. I’m amazed at the number of critics who let his attitudes slide right by them. Cineaste: If you’re critical of the Eastwood films, why is Peckinpah such a favorite? Kael: I never said he was a good person. But he had a true gift as a moviemaker. I try to look at the quality of the work. That includes the quality of the perceptions. Cineaste: Was Peckinpah’s machismo more posture than reality? Kael: Yes. but he lived the posture. Cineaste: What was the nature of your relationship with Altman? Cassavetes? Kael: I loved Altman’s work, but I was never close to him personally. I’ve met him only a few times. He’s a great risk-taking director, and McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Nashville are superb films. And I wouldn’t leave out The Long Goodbye, Thieves Like Us, or Vincent and Theo. I met Cassavetes one evening on the West Coast just as I was coming East in the mid-Sixties. It’s very’ strange that Cassavetes, who is identified with new directions in movies, had so little knowledge of movie history; he didn’t know the experimental work of the Twenties and Thirties—I was flabbergasted to learn he had never heard of\\xa0Un chien andalou. There was a naive streak in a lot of what he did. I liked Shadows, but felt that he got into a trap with the films he made with Ben Gazzara and Peter Falk. I felt those movies were tediously overwrought and that he—out of love, no doubt—did the wrong things with Gena Rowlands, who had been wonderful in her pre-Cassavetes work. I felt she was acting all the time in Cassavetes’s movies; she never relaxed. It drove me crazy. I don’t fully understand why so many students and young directors made an idol of Cassavetes. But I could see that they were deeply affected by those movies in which men sit around joshing each other and being pig\\xadgish. Cineaste: Few film critics have your capacity to capture the quality of an actor’s performance. Kael: I think so much of what we respond to in fictional movies is acting. That’s one of the elements that’s often left out when people talk theoretically about movies. They forget it’s the human material we go to see. A movie without actors is not, generally, a very compelling or memorable movie. There are great documentarians, of course, and directors who can make movies where we’re fascinated by the whole look and feel of things, but generally we need an actor, or a group of actors, to involve us emotionally. Or just to pep things up—the way Christopher Plummer peps up The Insider. Or the way Mike Nichols brings something dazzling and original to The Des',\n",
       "  'ignated Mourner. Or, to look back, the way that Debra Winger could be piercing. Movies give us presents: people like Judy Davis, a wizard at conveying neurosis and making it witty. They give us the sheer charm of Drew Barrymore. Cineaste: A film critic has written that Pauline Kael seems the most “unself doubting person I’ve ever met.” Given that you write your pieces after only a single viewing, has your self-confidence as a critic ever faltered? Kael: I’m not a very insecure person. Maybe that has something to do with my having been the youngest in a large family. I was funny, so they liked me and always encouraged me to talk. Would you rather I studied a movie? I feel I get the movie on the first viewing more completely than I would get it if I labored over it. I like it best on the first viewing because it’s got suspense and excitement. This is a personal thing that I should probably never have told people about. I come from a generation that saw movies once. When 16mm projectors and film societies started to be popular, and, more recently, when movielovers got videos, they began to poke over the movies endlessly. I think that violates people’s first reactions; they become scholars of movies instead of people who respond to what they see. I don’t know why it would make those scholars feel better if I said I watched a picture five times. Cineaste: If you don’t doubt your perceptions, did you ever doubt your talent? Kael: I doubted my talent when I first tried to write. I was very pedestrian at first because I’d had a lot of university, and was a very good student. You learn to be pedestrian—to footnote everything and do all those damned things that they teach you to do at college that turn you into a bore. I doubted that I could ever loosen up enough as a writer, but I found I loosened up when I wrote about movies. Cineaste: Did being a woman present an obstacle to your career? Kael: I never thought of it as a career. It was more like a folly. Well, women then were gutsier than contemporary women think they were. And maybe I didn’t think about obstacles because I never felt any pressure in the family to be any less than the boys. It never scared me to be one of the few women critics in a male world. I found that many of the male critics could be quite stupid. But more often they were just scared people who wanted to be in the swing of things, and tried to please their editors and the advertisers. They were gutless, and they’re still gutless. On the other hand, a lot of them lost their jobs by panning movies that had heavy advertising budgets. Cineaste: Some critics have asserted that your real genius is sociological, and that you are antagonistic to the European art film. Kael: That’s a hostile question, especially with the sly “your real genius.” Have you read me on Gillo Pontecorvo or Francesco Rosi? Have you read me on Bertolucci’s 1900 or Truffaut’s Story of Adele H. or Visconti’s The Leopard or Tanner’s Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000 or Bellocchio’s Chi',\n",
       "  'na Is Near and Leap Into the Void? Or do you think I should have written more about the draggy ones? I know there are people who fell in love with the high-art qualities of movies, but I can’t fully account for that phenomenon. I understand that some people dismiss me as “the ultimate democrat” because I like a lot of popular movies. But popular movies got me involved in movies in the first place, so why deny them now? Many of us love the actors, the excitement, the trashiness, the pure pleasure, without feeling we need to justify that pleasure. Cineaste: Still, given your critical sympathy for the sexual energy and kineticism of films, isn’t there some implicit antipathy towards art films directed by people like Dreyer and Bresson? Kael: You’ve got the wrong people for me to be antipathetic towards. I’m not generally drawn to the directors who make spiritual movies that seem to occur in slow motion, such as Ozu and Tarkovsky. But I loved Dreyer’s Passion of Joan of Arc and Day of Wrath. As he got older, I didn’t respond to his movies in the same way. They simply weren’t for me. Bresson is the only director who made a film (Diary of a Country Priest) that put me to sleep twice. I don’t understand why, since I think it’s a great movie; I admired it while I was dozing. Cineaste:: What about Godard? Kael: Oh, I loved writing about films like La Chinoise, Masculine/Feminine and Weekend. I was hired at The New Yorker partly because of a piece I wrote on Godard in The New Republic. William Shawn read it, and, having admired some of Godard’s movies, talked to me about coming to The New Yorker. Cineaste: The Seventies were arguably the most creative decade in American film. What is your opinion of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, Peter Biskind’s account of Seventies Hollywood? Kael: It’s a piece of semifictional fantasy. He puts me, for instance, in the middle of situations that I don’t know anything about. And I’ve heard from other people that he treated them similarly. But it’s his approach that’s really sickening. Here’s this great, heroic era in American films, when people were struggling against all sorts of forces to get their visions onto the screen, and they achieved it. It’s the greatest period in our movies. Films like Nashville, and The Godfather I and II, The Landlord, Shampoo, Mean Streets, McCabe and Mrs. Miller—dozens of great films, or at least amazing ones—were made. And all Biskind does is try to make everybody look like a backstabbing egomaniac. However they may have misbehaved, those people had to have some commitment to the art of movies to do what they did. He’s using our knowledge of how great that period was as a come-on to read about how swinish the people were. Cineaste: Would you say that the Seventies directors were able to harness their self-destructiveness into creative work? Kael: Their self-destructiveness sometimes worked against them. Ashby died young, and some of the others never did as great work again. Directors such as Wyler and Hitchcock who l',\n",
       "  'asted for decades had a studio system supporting them. These guys had to pull it all out of themselves. It’s miraculous, really, what they did. When you go to a movie now, it doesn’t give you the tensions in how people live now in the way their movies did. Cineaste: What has happened to Coppola’s career since the Seventies? Kael: I think people sometimes burn themselves out, particularly in making movies. He’s done some respectable work since then. Some of his pictures have promising conceptions, such as Peggy Sue Got Married and Tucker and Gardens of Stone, but he doesn’t fully realize them. He seems content just to put on a show. Still, if you have three or four great films to your credit, you shouldn’t be called a failure. An author who cared about movies would be obsessed with what a director like Coppola put into his movies—not what (in Biskind’s fancy) burned him out. Cineaste: You have written that you find films “a supremely pleasurable art form.” Are there any contemporary movies that provide that kind of emotional and esthetic charge? Kael: No, they don’t offer that richness. The Seventies movies meant so much to young people. They argued, thought about, and were really upset by them. Movies affected audiences in so many ways. The kids who said “Wow!” when they came out of a movie and couldn’t say any more were expressing some deep feeling. The kids who come out of Twister may say “Wow!” but it isn’t the same “Wow!” It’s a special-effects “Wow!” This doesn’t mean that movies are finished; it means they’re changing. Cineaste: In your critique of Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, you wrote that Kubrick is “a clean-minded pornographer that the film’s sex “has no sensuality,”\\xa0and its characters are “frigidly, pedantically calculated.” Isn’t much of that critique also applicable to Eyes Wide Shut? Kael: Yes, the two movies have a spirit in common. The big difference is that A Clockwork Orange got to audiences. It works. While Eyes Wide Shut is a lousy movie. A Clockwork Orange is lousy in its attitudes and its thinking. Sometimes I hate a movie more when it works. The thuggishness of Clockwork is comparable to that of some of the Nazi films that worked. Eyes Wide Shut can be ignored. Scene by scene it’s a howl. Cineaste: You’ve written that in E.T., “Spielberg is like a boy soprano lilting with joy.” What’s your opinion of his ostensibly more morally and socially serious work? Kael: He’s gone to the pulpit. Everything has gone flat in his directing. He had such flair in Jaws, and his early movies. He seemed so sophisticated and intelligent—so sharp about what he was doing. There’s still a little bit of joy in the Indiana Jones trilogy. But now there’s a real simpleton’s morality that he hands the audience, like when you hear him on television saying that everyone should be forced to see Schindler’s List. Soon he and Benigni, director of Life is Beautiful, will be working up a doubles act. Cineaste: As a critic, were your relations with directors ever problematic? Kae',\n",
       "  'l: No one enjoys being panned, but what are you suggesting? That my relations with directors were improper? I don’t think they were. How can you be involved in an art form and not know some of the artists? The important thing is to be honest about your responses to their work and not to profiteer off knowing them. Directors or actors do often say horrible things about a critic in print or on TV and then they may take the critic aside and try to square themselves. They may write you a little private apology—the apology is always private. Cineaste: Am I right that stylistically you prefer films that are looser, more improvisational and intuitive than those that are more calibrated? Kael: In general. But some calibrated movies work wonderfully. De Palma is not an improvisational director, and he’s made several movies, such as Casualties of War, that are as good as anything done in this country in the last decades. Some of his very early films were improvisational. Hi, Mom!, for one, is whoopingly giddy about race relations. I don’t mind elegant, careful filmmaking, such as Fred Schepisi’s work in The Russia House. I mind the overly controlled film, one too bound by a classic structure. I like movies to have a little looseness and bounce. Cineaste: Are you particularly susceptible to films that estheticize kitsch—movies like Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in America—that are vivid and vital despite having a second-rate script? Kael: Are you trying to nail me for something? I don’t understand what. The Sergio Leone film was kitsch alright—lyric kitsch; its image of Lower East Side immigrant life is absurd. Leone’s father worked in movies, and the boy literally grew up in the studio. All his movies are dream-plays. They derive from movies, and he didn’t seem to have any experience outside of movies and studio life. So his movies are visions sustained from childhood of Hollywood’s version of America. Cineaste: Do you feel that some of the younger American directors have been shaped by movies and nothing more? Kael: They sometimes make a smashing beginning and you think they’re going to have a great career, but they lack the experience, the point of view, and the taste. They haven’t read enough or seen enough of the other arts to grow as moviemakers. Movies by themselves are not enough of an education. Leone breathed a kind of visionary poetry into his epics, but most of the American film-school kids have a hard time projecting a strong enough vision to make their movies cohere. Then there are the very young kids who only seem to know hand-me-downs from Tarantino. Cineaste: You’ve also written about the special “aphrodisia” of films. Would you expand on what you mean? Kael: When we first begin seeing movies they have an erotic quality. It’s one of the first attractions that kids feel for them. Part of the appeal of movies is the sensuality of the actors and actresses—their faces give us pleasure. The symmetry of their beauty is often very appealing. They’re more beautiful th',\n",
       "  'an the people we see in life, and they give us standards of beauty and feeling. Their emotions transform us. Someone like Garbo opened up a generation of moviegoers to a kind of sensuality they didn’t experience elsewhere. There’s something about a great actress on screen that can be extraordinary. Garbo had something else plus beauty. When you watch her in the scene in A Woman of Affairs, where she inhales a bouquet of roses, you think you’ve never seen anyone inhale so completely. It’s not comparable to what goes on on the stage. The closeness of the people and the darkness of the movie theater and the private quality of our emotions make us relate to the actors in a special way. I think people make a huge mistake when they become interested in film and don’t give the actors and actresses more consideration. The popular audience reacts to a movie as a work with so-and-so. That really is the basis of our wanting to see more movies. That’s still the case. There’s nothing comparable to the pleasure people get from soaking in beauty. Teenagers certainly go to movies to look at Leonardo di Caprio, Keanu Reeves, and Brendan Fraser. Girls and boys want to look at Rachel Weisz, Jenna Elfman, Jennifer Lopez, and Gina Gershon, with her lovely warped smile—ideal for villainy. Even the special effects in The Matrix had a poetic quality—I don’t think people were going to see that film for the story. There’s something about watching Sigourney Weaver in Galaxy Quest that’s like nothing else. It’s fun watching big, strong women strutting their stuff. It’s fun seeing talent reveal itself—I’m thinking of Amanda Plummer and Madeleine Stowe and Fairuza Balk. Cineaste: Do you have regrets about pieces you have written, and, more importantly, about retiring? Kael: I have regrets about retiring, and some of them have to do with extraordinary movies that I would have loved to review. I still love going to movies, and I feel a pang, sometimes, that I could have pointed out to readers some good ones that were passed over or disappeared. I would have liked to write positive things about Bertolucci’s Besieged, Bertrand Blier’s My Man, and Lasse Hallström’s The Cider House Rules. Chris Marker’s The Last Bolshevik is a great film that almost no one has seen. Run Lola Run I’d have enjoyed reviewing. Being John Malkovich kept me on my toes for about twenty minutes, but by the time it was over I felt no desire to write about it. In any case, I no longer have the words; I hesitate. I loved writing about movies and I miss it, of course. But look: I was lucky, I lived in the century of pop. Or let me put it this way: culture without pop, to quote a phrase from McCabe “freezes my soul.” That’s why I’m not so keen on Loach and Sayles. David O. Russell’s political farce Three Kings is much more to my taste. I like the mixture of tones— Gunga Din and something of what Richard Lester was trying for in How I Won the War. It’s got pop in it; it keeps you alive. Source: Cineaste, Vol. 25, No. 2 (2000), pp. 8-']]"

       "[['Oliver Stone conducted interviews with Vladimir Putin on four separate trips to Russia for a total of nine days between July 2, 2015 and February 10, 2017. The following is a selection of parts of the interviews where Putin talks about Ukraine. * * * July 4, 2015 STONE: Okay, Ukraine. I want to say first of all that I interviewed Mr. Yanukovych here in Moscow a few months ago. And he told me his version of events. PUTIN: The thing is, here is an objective sequence of events. These events can be assessed differently, and you can name these events using different words, different formulas. But it’s quite evident you can follow what was happening day after day. And then you can give the people a chance to make an assessment of their own of what has really happened. STONE: Well, I would like your perspective on it from November to February 20th, 2013 into 2014. During those three months, there was quite a bit of protest in Ukraine. You must have been aware of it. PUTIN: Do you want to know what was happening in Ukraine starting from the early 1990s? What was happening there was the systemic robbery of the Ukrainian people. Right away after independence, Ukraine started an even wilder privatization and robbery of state property, which led to the deterioration of the standard of living—right after Ukraine gained independence. Whatever powers came into force, nothing changed for the lives of ordinary people. And certainly the pe',\n",
       "  'ople were fed up with all those arbitrary actions and that crazy corruption, the impoverishment and the illegal enrichment of other people. That was the root of the discontent the people were feeling. And certainly people were thinking that exiting in any way to the EU would liberate them from the terrible conditions they had found themselves in starting from the beginning of the 1990s. I think that was the driving force behind the developments in Ukraine. And the crisis was sparked, as is well known, when President Yanukovych said he had to postpone the signing of the association agreement with the European Union. That was the starting point. And our partners in Europe and the United States managed to mount this horse of discontent of the people. And instead of trying to find out what was really happening, they decided to support the coup d’état. And now let me tell you how it unfolded and what our position was. Mr. Yanukovych announced that he had to postpone, not cancel, the signing of the association agreement with the European Union because, at that moment, Ukraine had already been a member of the Free Trade Area of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States). Ukraine itself was the engine behind the establishment of the free trade area in the CIS space. And it was the force that led to the creation of this zone. As a result of this, and the fact that the economies of Russia and Ukraine were emerging as a united eco',\n",
       "  'nomy and had unique economic relations, many of our enterprises could not exist independently. There was very deep co-operation between those enterprises. The markets of Russia were absolutely open to imports from Ukraine. We had and still have a zero tariff barrier. We have a single energy system and a single transportation system. There are many other elements which bring our economies together. For 17 years we have been in negotiations with the European Union on the conditions of Russia’s accession to the WTO, and all of a sudden, it was announced to us that Ukraine and the EU were signing an association agreement. And that meant the opening up of the Ukrainian markets. It meant that the technical standards and trade regulation and other elements of the economic policy of the EU were to be implemented in Ukraine, and that was happening very fast without a transition period. At the same time, our customs border with Ukraine was absolutely open. And the EU was able to enter our territory with all of their goods without any negotiations, despite the agreements—principled agreements—which we had reached with them before, during those 17-year talks on our accession to the WTO. Certainly we had to respond to that. And we said that if Ukraine had decided to act like that it was its choice. And we respected that choice. But this didn’t mean that we had to pay for that choice. Why do people living in Russia today have to pay fo',\n",
       "  'r this choice the Ukrainian leadership has made? That’s why we told them that we would have to take protective measures, and those protected measures were nothing special and they were not discriminatory. We were just trying to extend the regular trade regime to the territory of Ukraine which in international private law is called most favored nation status. So we’re just going to withdraw the preferences. But without preferences, the Ukrainian enterprises would not exist too long in the Russian market. And we proposed that we hold talks with our European partners in a trilateral format. But there was a flat refusal. They told us that we had better stay out of it. They told us, if we are talking to Canada, you would not interfere, right? If you are in talks with China, we are not interfering with those talks—that’s what they told us. And they asked us not to interfere in their relations with Ukraine. And we said, those situations are quite different—Canada, China, and Russia/Ukrainian relations—these are different stories. But we told them, if you think like that then we’re not going to interfere. But in that case, we ask them to respect our right to undertake protective measures and to continue this economic policy. I would go even further, talking about the economics, and after the coup d’état, after the leadership changed in Ukraine, and Mr. Poroshenko arrived in power, at the request of our American partners and the r',\n",
       "  'equest of the Ukrainian side, we did not implement protective measures. Whereas the Ukrainian leadership signed the association agreement with the European Union. And they ratified this agreement, and after that they postponed that agreement from entering into force until January 1st, 2016. So you’re now shooting this documentary in mid-2015, and as of now, this association agreement between Ukraine and the EU has not yet entered into force. That’s exactly what I had proposed to Mr. Yanukovych. He had proposed that the signing should be postponed. So the question is what was the reason for the coup d’état? Why did they drive this country into chaos, into civil war? So what was the sense behind all that? And now as to the unfolding of the political situation, indeed you have now mentioned the fact that there were riots and a coup d’état was perpetrated. Let me remind you that before that, on February 21st, 2014, if my memory serves me correctly, three foreign ministers from European countries arrived in Kiev. They took part in the meeting between President Yanukovych and the opposition, and they agreed that early elections were to be held. They agreed on the future of relations between the president and the opposition. And the following day, President Yanukovych went to the second largest city of Ukraine, Kharkov—he went there to participate in a regional conference. And once he departed, his residence was seized, his admi',\n",
       "  'nistration was seized, and the government was seized as well with the use of force. What would you call that? And the Prosecutor General was shot at, one of his security officers was wounded. And the motorcade of President Yanukovych himself was shot at. So it’s nothing more than an armed seizure of power. Naturally, someone supported this coup d’état. Where I started from this—not just personally against Yanukovych, but against the government itself because people were fed up with the chaos of what was happening. The poverty, they were fed up with it, as well as with corruption. After power was seized, some people liked it. But others didn’t like it. People were frightened by this surge of nationalism, radicalism. The first thing the newly-arrived in power started to talk about was the need to adopt a law limiting the use of the Russian language. The Europeans prevented them from doing that. But the signal had already been sent to society, and people understood the direction the country was moving towards in such places as Crimea, where the overwhelming majority of people are Russians by nationality. Whereas Ukrainians who live in those places, as a whole, believe their native language to be the Russian language. Certainly, people in Crimea were especially frightened by this situation. Furthermore there were threats made against them directly. And all that led to the circumstances which are well known. I’ve elaborated on',\n",
       "  ' them on many occasions, so if you are interested, I can repeat. But something like that started to happen in the southeastern part of Ukraine on the whole. In the territory which is called Donbass, there are two large cities, and people didn’t accept the coup d’état there either. First there were attempts at arresting them using the police, but the police defected to their side quite quickly. Then the central authorities started to use special forces and in the night people were snatched and taken to prison. And afterwards there was the tragedy in Odessa. And people who were unarmed took to the streets for peaceful protests and they were pushed into a building and were massacred atrociously. Even pregnant women. That is a catastrophe. But still no one is going to investigate it. Certainly not people in Donbass. After that they took up arms. But once hostilities started, instead of engaging in a dialogue with people in the southeast part of Ukraine, after they used Special Forces, they started to use weapons directly—tanks and even military aircraft. There were strikes from the multiple rocket launchers against residential neighborhoods. We repeatedly appealed to the new leadership of Ukraine, asking them to abstain from extreme actions. They started hostilities once, they were put to rout, they stopped, then elections took place, then this new president arrived in power. I talked to him [Poroshenko] on many occasions. I ',\n",
       "  'tried to persuade him not to resume hostilities. And he had an opinion of his own about what was happening. He always referred to the losses his forces had sustained to two or three as people during the hostilities with the militia. Certainly that was a tragedy. It is always sad when people die. But when he resumed the hostilities, thousands of people died. And the official forces suffered another defeat. Then they started hostilities for the third time. And once again they were defeated. After that, the latest Minsk Agreements were signed. They agreed that these agreements would be adhered to by both parties. Unfortunately, we’re not witnessing that, and I think the official authorities in Kiev are not willing to engage in any direct dialogue with Donbass. They refuse to be engaged in direct dialogue. Up to now. All the provisions of the Minsk agreements stipulate directly that issues related to amendments to the Constitution, issues related to the adoption of the law, on municipal elections, issues related to this special status of Donbass—all these issues have to be coordinated, that’s what it says. But nothing like that is happening. Right now, the Kiev authorities are trying to make amendments to the Constitution. But according to the information I have—just yesterday I received new information—there is no contact, no negotiations with Donbass. Moreover, the Minsk agreements say directly that the law which had alread',\n",
       "  'y been adopted by the Verkhovna Rada should enter into force. This is along with the special status of Donbass. Unfortunately, just several days ago President Poroshenko announced that no special status would be granted to Donbass. I have to talk to him. I have to understand what it means. Does it mean that the Kiev authorities refuse to adhere to the Minsk agreements? There are other considerations at work here. One of the provisions of the Minsk agreements says that it’s necessary to adopt a law on amnesty. But the law has not been adopted yet. How can you talk to people in Donbass who are threatened with criminal prosecution? Another provision—the economy and the social sphere of Donbass have to be restored. But instead the authorities are strengthening the blockade of these territories. And all things boiled down to one thing—they are saying that Donbass is fighting against them and that’s why they’re not going to pay them anything. And I say there are pensioners who are entitled, according to the law of Ukraine, to a pension, that there are people with disabilities who are not fighting anyone. They are just victims of this situation—hostages. I asked them, “Do you consider them to be citizens of your country? Well in that case you have to take care of them.” Their response was quite simple—“We do not have money and we’re not going to pay them anything.” We are supplying energy. Ukraine has refused to pay for that ene',\n",
       "  'rgy. So on the whole, it’s a full-fledged, very tough blockade. Many people criticize Israel for the blockade of Palestine. I’m not going to elaborate on that, I’m not going to talk about that because it’s a different story entirely. But the same thing is happening here and everyone seems not to notice what is happening. There is not enough food there, not enough medicine. Nothing. And that is a serious issue. We assume that there is no other way to find a solution to this issue, other than adhering to the Minsk agreements—they have to be implemented. We always hear appeals that we have to influence somehow the leadership of these unrecognized republics. Just recently, the leaders of these republics announced publicly that they were willing to go back to the Ukrainian state under certain conditions—if the Minsk agreements were observed. But these agreements were not implemented. And Donbass is not to blame for that. Let me reiterate, I believe that there is no other way to settle this crisis. And the Minsk agreement is the only way toward that end. STONE: Well, obviously there are problems with it. What if the people in Donbass came across the border to Russia? That would be their only hope if things got really bad. PUTIN: Do you mean that the best way to solve this issue is to push these people from their homeland? STONE: I’m not saying that, I’m saying if they have no water, no food, and they can’t go on living, the onl',\n",
       "  'y way you can travel is on your feet. I mean we’re talking about major migration. PUTIN: Yes, many people have already resorted to these means—two and a half million Ukrainian citizens are in Russia. The overwhelming majority of them are men who are under conscription. They’re eligible for conscription. But in these territories there used to be four and a half million people. Right now estimates are around three million people are left there. STONE: So what if they come? PUTIN: Well, they are already doing that. They are coming. But once the situation quiets down, they go back to their homes. STONE: Yes, I understand. Of course the Kiev government would claim that the Russian army or the Russian government has intervened already in Ukraine with the annexation of Crimea. And the troops—they’re saying there are paratroopers or whatever you want to call them, contractors, soldiers and arms dealers helping them or helping the separatists. PUTIN: As to Crimea, I’d like to ask you, what is democracy? Democracy is a policy which is based on the will of the people. And how do we know the will of the people? In a modern world we use the voting procedure. People came to a referendum and there were no whips, no machine guns. And you cannot use these means to make a person come to a polling station to vote. People came, the turnout was more than 90 percent. And more than 90 percent voted in favor of re-unifying with Russia. The choic',\n",
       "  'e of the people has to be respected. And you cannot try to conform international law to your political interests against the principles of democracy. STONE: Nonetheless, the United States would say that you have violated international law—and that’s been a theme that has been repeated again and again by the EU. And you yourself acknowledged that the US had done that in Iraq, so it’s a question of course, at the end of the day, of power, isn’t it? PUTIN: Yes, that’s correct. As to armed forces of the United States coming to Iraq. And there were no elections there. No elections were held. As to Crimea, yes, we created conditions for people to be able to come to polling stations. But we were not engaged in any hostilities there, no one was shooting there, no one was killed. STONE: But literally the US would argue that elections were held eventually in Iraq. PUTIN: In the end, yes, but before that there was a war. And there was no war in Crimea. That’s the first thing. Secondly, there is another criticism addressed to Russia. They are saying that international law was violated. I have already talked about that but I’d like to emphasize that in the course of the Kosovo crisis, the International Court of Justice considered very cautiously this situation and the ICJ arrived at a conclusion saying that when the issue of self-determination of a nation is concerned, in accordance with Point Two of the United Nations charter, if my ',\n",
       "  'memory serves me correctly, the concerns of the central authorities of this or that country on this matter are not required. And thirdly, since you are preparing this documentary and you have time, I’d like to ask you to do something—have a look at what was said on that matter by the representatives of the United States, and the representatives of certain European countries—Germany, Great Britain—what they said in those matters when they were talking about them with the ICJ. All of them were saying that no consent from Belgrade was needed, and they were saying that everything was done in accordance with the United Nations Charter. I was always wondering if Kosovars were allowed to do it, why is that not allowed to Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, and Crimeans? There is no difference whatsoever. Moreover, the decision on the independence of Kosovo was adopted by the decision of the parliament. Whereas, in Crimea first the parliament voted in favor of independence, and afterwards they held a referendum and during that referendum the people said that they were willing to go back to Russia. Every step has a reason behind it. STONE: Was there any UN condemnation of the annexation of Crimea? PUTIN: No, I don’t know anything of that. STONE: Can we talk a little bit about the airplane that was shot down in July—the Malaysian Airliner [MH17]? PUTIN: Yes, certainly. STONE: Thank you. I’ve heard both sides. I know Russian intelligence ',\n",
       "  'has claimed there were two planes in the air, or at least two planes, and there was a possible shooting down of the airplane from another aircraft. Is that correct? PUTIN: There are two principal versions. The first version is that this plane was shot down by the Buk air defense system of the Ukrainian armed forces. And the second version is that the same system, the same system of arms—the Buk systems that are produced in Russia—was employed by the militia, the separatists. Primarily, let me say that in any case it’s a terrible catastrophe. And that is simply atrocious. And in this regard, let me say something. That would not have happened if the leadership of Ukraine had listened to us and had not started full-fledged hostilities. It was the Ukrainian authorities who started to use all kinds of weapons systems in Donbass. Now as to the aircraft, the planes which were in the air—as far as I know, right away after this terrible catastrophe, one of the Ukrainian air controllers, I think he was a specialist originating from Spain, announced that he had seen a military aircraft in the corridor assigned for civil aircraft. And there could have been no other military aircraft than the one controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. Certainly that needs to be investigated. I’m not saying that this plane was shot down. I do not say that this military aircraft shot down the civil aircraft, but the question is what was that plane doi',\n",
       "  'ng in the corridor because that is against the existing rules of the international flights of civil air aviation. As for the Buk air defense systems, which can send missiles from Earth—according to our specialists and experts, and not just our intelligence services but also our ballistic experts—the reports that I’ve received say that the strike hit the tail of the aircraft. And if that is the case, then that is exactly where the air defense system of the Ukrainian armed forces were stationed. So I don’t understand what they were doing there in the first place. Why were they there and why were they pulled out of there so quickly? In any case, that requires a thorough and de-politicized investigation. STONE: Do you believe the American intelligence has any information about this, because wouldn’t they be watching this situation after the coup? Wouldn’t they have intelligence from satellites and whatever? PUTIN: I’m confident that that is exactly the case. But regrettably, there is no proof from the partners that we’ve received. STONE: But they have not shown much? PUTIN: No, that’s quite understandable, because we understand their position on Ukraine. And certainly they all wanted to shift the blame on the militia fighters in Donbass and indirectly Russia, who supports the militia. STONE: So if they had contrary information they don’t want to release it? PUTIN: Yes, if this information is contrary then they will never reve',\n",
       "  'al it. STONE: Can we talk about outside influences in this Ukraine story now? PUTIN: Yes, certainly. STONE: We know about the NGOs that were operating in Ukraine. We know that Victoria Nuland, the Undersecretary of State for Eastern Europe I believe, was very active supporting a change in government. We know that Senator John McCain visited and was seen at rallies with extremist leaders, including some neo-Nazis. We know that America and the National Endowment for Democracy, which is also a very influential private nonprofit NGO was very active, very active here. Paul Gershman, who was the president of it made very strong independent speeches—he wanted an independent Ukraine. And we know that the Hungarian billionaire hedge funder George Soros was also very involved in supporting the groups in Ukraine. PUTIN: Yes, all that is true. You know I do not always understand the rationale behind the actions of our partners. I already said that sometimes I fall under the impression that they’ve got to control or enforce some discipline in their Euro-Atlantic camp. And to that end they need some external enemy. And despite all the concerns they have, Iran at this point cannot fulfill this need. STONE: In other words, the United States can keep a united pro-American Europe and NATO with an external enemy such as Russia. PUTIN: I can say something definitely—that is true. I know that, I feel that. Without this internal discipline, th',\n",
       "  'e Euro-Atlantic cause is destabilized. This is not the Cold War we’re living in. Several years ago, certain leaders told me that our American friends were asking me to frighten them. But they said that they were not afraid. They understood that the world had changed. And that external threat—it is impossible to enforce this strict discipline. And in that regard, that is probably in the interests of someone, but I think that is the wrong logic. Because this logic is looking back into the past. But you have to look into the future. You have to understand that the world is different now. There are new threats arising, strategic threats included. You cannot freeze it as if we were still living through the Cold War. I told you about the ABM system, about the ABM treaty, about the fight against terrorism. Regrettably, I have to say that all our attempts at fostering a relationship with the United States were met either with the lack of understanding or total indifference. But this situation cannot persist. STONE: I’m surprised. I’ve always had great respect for Russian intelligence services and their knowledge of the West, but in this situation I was surprised by their lack of, it seems, information of what was going on in Ukraine. It’s been said that you yourself were surprised by this takeover, and that you were paying attention to the Sochi Olympics and you weren’t paying attention to what was going on in Ukraine. What happe',\n",
       "  'ned to your intelligence service? PUTIN: No, that is not true. I had a fairly good picture of what was happening within Ukrainian society. And there is no doubt about that. This take-over could have happened at any time. There was a takeover when Kuchma was leaving office. STONE: And a pro-Western group came in, is that what you’re saying? PUTIN: Yes, and Yanukovych was the one to win the elections. But the street did not agree with that outcome of the election, and a third round of elections was proclaimed in violation of the Constitution. So it was also a quasi-coup d’état. Back then I thought they had made a grave mistake. Even though pro-Western politicians arrived in power, people very soon lost their confidence in those leaders as well. Because those politicians continue to do everything that had been done before them by the previous leaders of the country. And that’s why they were defeated in the subsequent elections. Unfortunately, President Yanukovych didn’t manage to change much in the country either. And the same thing happened to him. The very paradigm has to be changed of their relation to the people. They were talking about the need to get rid of the oligarchs. And now the oligarchs are in power. So nothing has changed really. They were talking about the need to get rid of corruption. What has changed? Nothing. The governor of the Odessa region is now former President [of Georgia] Saakashvili. STONE: Yeah, I',\n",
       "  ' know. PUTIN: That’s just a spit in the face, an insult to the people of Odessa and to the whole of the Ukrainian people. I do not want to give any assessments of Saakashvili, I think that would be the wrong thing to do. Whatever person he is, he was president of a nation [Georgia]. And it is up to the Georgian people to give him assessments. And besides, we are personally acquainted with him. He was not even granted a working visa in the United States. The investors he tried to get did not want to give him a permanent job. But quite strangely, he can act as the governor of the Odessa region [in Ukraine]. Are there no people with integrity, people from Ukraine who can do this job quite as well? It’s just ridiculous. And it’s an insult to the Ukrainian people. STONE: I have three specific questions about Ukraine, then perhaps we can take a walk? During the Maidan massacre, did you get any intelligence of what was going on? It’s the strangest massacre. Because of the number of casualties of policemen, and the civilians who were killed, and the policemen not firing back, they were retreating and called back by Yanukovych. And during that it seems like there was a sniper force that was definitely aiming at the policemen and civilians to create the chaos necessary for the takeover. PUTIN: To start with, that is absolutely correct. Yanukovych didn’t give an order to use weapons against civilians. And incidentally, our western p',\n",
       "  'artners, including the United States, asked us to influence him so that he did not give any orders to those weapons. And President Yanukovych said that he couldn’t imagine any other way of dealing with this situation. He couldn’t sign an order on the use of weapons. And when both the police and the protesters were shot at, it’s correct what you’ve said—the goal was to sow chaos. And certainly President Yanukovych was not interested in the expansion of this chaos. He was interested in containing the situation. But I have to say that the so-called protesters were very aggressive. STONE: Some of them, yes. PUTIN: Some of them centered in the office of the party of regents which was headed by President Yanukovych. And they burned it down. And technical workers came out and they said we are not members of the party. There was one electrician. And he was shot and they were thrown into the basement and then everything was burned. And that was even before the takeover. So Yanukovych was not interested in chaos, he did everything he could in order to quiet the situation, to restore calm. STONE: Well, who are these snipers? PUTIN: Well, who could have placed these snipers? Interested parties, parties who wanted to escalate the situation. I do not have any data on who precisely those snipers were, but elementary logic tells me. STONE: Have you heard any reports about the training that was going on in other cities, in Minsk and so fo',\n",
       "  'rth, of battalions and the Right Sector—hardened people of the right? There were 100-man units that came to the city, I am told, in the days before the Maidan massacre. PUTIN: No, not in Minsk, but we have information available to us that armed groups were trained in the western parts of Ukraine itself, in Poland, and in a number of other places. STONE: I see. Have you heard of the Azov battalion? PUTIN: Yes, certainly. There are certain armed formations which are not accountable to anyone, nor are they accountable to the central authorities in Kiev. I believe that is one of the reasons why the current leadership right now cannot put an end to these hostilities. That is simply because they are frightened that these uncontrollable armed forces will return to the capital. STONE: My second question—Mr. Obama, during this period, what kind of communications did you have with him? PUTIN: We were in constant contact. Well, I can say it was almost on a permanent basis. And Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov, they had personal meetings months ago and they also had telephone conversations. And myself and the president of the United States, we both had a great deal of regular telephone conversations. STONE: Obviously you didn’t agree. PUTIN: Yes, we had different assessments as to the causes of the Ukrainian crisis and its unfolding. STONE: Are you still talking to him? PUTIN: Yes, just a couple of days ago I had a telephone conversation wit',\n",
       "  'h him. We talked about our bilateral relations, the Middle East situation, and also the Ukrainian situation. But I have to tell you—I think that there is some understanding on a number of issues—despite the differences in our assessments. There is some common understanding. STONE: Would you say relations or the dialogue is cordial? PUTIN: No, but they are businesslike. And quite even. STONE: Do you see each other visually when you talk? PUTIN: No, but I can tell you that this dialogue is a dialogue of interested parties. So there is no confrontation behind it. I think that President Obama is a thinking person, he assesses the real situation, with some things he agrees, with others he disagrees. But we also manage to find points of common understanding on a number of complicated issues. And this is a fruitful dialogue. STONE: This is a just a trivial question, but I’ve always been curious, do you call each other Vladimir and Barack? PUTIN: Yes. STONE: You call him Barack or Barry? PUTIN: Barack. STONE: You do—first name, that’s great. Last question—Sebastopol and the meaning of it. It was your major submarine base, I believe, on the Black Sea. And it has obviously been a major defense facility. And you had an agreement with Crimea to have troops there—it was a base that was agreed to. I don’t know exactly when the treaty was made. How, when this was going down, obviously this is important in your mind—if the United States ',\n",
       "  'or NATO troops are able to take over this base, what are the consequences of that? PUTIN: I was thinking that this never was supposed to happen. Well, there is the subjunctive mood as we say, but there can be no subjunctive mood in politics—the “what if.” STONE: Hypothetical. PUTIN: And this treaty with Ukraine was supposed to be enforced until 2019. And after that it was supposed to be prolonged even further, I don’t remember—another 20 years probably. But in response to that we reduced the price of Russian natural gas for Ukraine. We gave them a large discount. And I’d like to draw attention to the fact that even though Crimea is right now part of the Russian Federation, this gas discount for Ukraine has not been withdrawn. STONE: Right. The consequences of a US seizure of the base or a NATO base? PUTIN: Those consequences would have been very grave, because, well this base per-se doesn’t mean anything—no significance, but if they had tried to station either ABM systems or offensive systems in those territories, that would no doubt have aggravated this situation in the whole of Europe. Incidentally, that is what is happening in Eastern European countries. I already talked about that. I just wanted to tell you about one nuance—why we are responding so acutely to the expansion of NATO? Well, as a matter of fact, we understand the value—or lack thereof—and the threat of this organization. I know this organization is a loos',\n",
       "  'e one and it’s not viable, even despite Article 5 of the treaty. What we’re concerned about is the practice of how decisions are made there. I know how decisions are made there. And the experience of previous years of work has given me full information as to how decisions are made. When a country becomes a member of NATO, bilateral talks are held on this country and it’s quite easy to deal with this country on a bilateral basis, including on the placement of weapons systems that are threatening to our security. Once a country becomes a member of NATO, it is hard to resist the pressure of such a large presence as the United States, and any weapons system can be stationed in this country all of a sudden. An ABM system, new military bases, and if need be, new offensive systems. And what are we supposed to do in that case? In this case we have to take countermeasures, and that means that we have to aim our missile systems at facilities which, in our view, are becoming a threat to us. And the situation becomes more tense. And who needs that, and why? STONE: You said that the base in Crimea didn’t mean anything in itself. Does that mean to say that you would have built another naval base on the Black Sea elsewhere? PUTIN: We already built such a military base. STONE: Oh, where’s that? PUTIN: In the city of Novorossiysk. And it’s more modern, more sophisticated than the last one. STONE: Interesting. What province or region? PUTI',\n",
       "  'N: It’s the Krasnodar region between Sochi and the Crimea. STONE: I see, good to know. PUTIN: So it’s also the Black Sea coast. Right. Thank you very much. * * * May 9, 2016 STONE: Quick updates on Syria and Ukraine—I’m talking about security on the borders of Russia. I was very impressed with the classical music symphony in Palmyra, but can you give me a quick update on Syria as it concerns Russian security and Ukraine? PUTIN: As far as Ukraine is concerned, I think you know what is going on. They have this crisis which, in a slackened form, is still going on. I think that the most important component of the Minsk Agreement is the political settlement, but regrettably it is up to the Kiev authorities to implement this part of the agreement, and so far they are not doing that. They should have amended the Constitution in accordance with the Minsk Agreement, and that should have been done before the end of 2015. But they didn’t do that. They were supposed to pass a bill, a law on amnesty. This law was adopted by the parliament, but it was not signed by the president, nor has it entered into force yet. There is another law that should be adopted and that should enter into force—that is the law on the special status of these unrecognized republics. The current Ukrainian leadership says the following: they say that since, at the line of conflict, there are still clashes, there is still violence, then they say the conditions a',\n",
       "  're not yet in place to implement this political settlement. But in my view, this is only a hollow pretext because you can easily create a clash somewhere at the line of contact and then this is going to go on ad infinitum. The most important thing right now is to achieve a political settlement. Then there is a second course which explains why this is being done according to the Ukrainian counterparts. The Ukrainian leadership insisting that the Russian-Ukrainian border where the unrecognized republics are located, should be closed. And indeed the Minsk Agreements presuppose the closing of the Russian border by the Ukrainian frontier offices, but only after the key political decisions have been taken. But until these political decisions have been taken and implemented, until people are safe in those unrecognized republics, the closing of the border will only mean one thing—that they are going to be encircled and later eliminated. We talked about that during the long night when we hammered out the Minsk agreements. We talked about that in great detail. And our Ukrainian counterparts first agreed to that, but right now they seem as if they do not understand what is going on. Right now we support a proposal set forth by President Poroshenko to reinforce the observer contingent on the line of contact. He is the one who initiated this proposal and I have supported it. Moreover, he suggested that the OSC observers should be equi',\n",
       "  'pped with arms and we support that as well. The problem is further aggravated by the fact that the economic and internal political situation in Ukraine has deteriorated dramatically. And right now, some of our partners—I’m not going to name them—are saying that the Ukrainian president is not capable of making these political decisions due to the difficult internal political situation in Ukraine. And a year ago, I suggested that President Poroshenko should hold early elections and thereby reinforce his position, so that, even though we had differences, he would be able to push through all the required political decisions. But back then, our American friends, our European friends told us that the prime minister—back then it was Mr. Yatsenyuk and President Poroshenko had to pull their efforts together, they had to work together and we know how it ended—by a split up in the government and a very difficult political situation. And right now when I remind our partners of that, they simply shrug their shoulders. The question is, how does Russia fit into all this. And the United States and Europe keep coming up with new accusations, trying to accuse Russia of something new because they cannot publicly admit that they’ve made mistakes. That’s why they choose to blame Russia. We have quite a famous poet who wrote fables—his name was Krylov—and one of these fables features a dialogue between a wolf and a lamb. In this dialogue with ',\n",
       "  'the wolf, the lamb is trying to justify himself, saying that he is not to blame for anything. And once the wolf has run out of arguments, he decides to put an end to this discussion. And he says, “Dear lamb, you are only to blame because I am hungry.” [laughter] STONE: If this happens—you used the word “eliminated” I believe—what’s the worst-case? I mean, how many Russian-Ukrainians would be at risk? PUTIN: It’s not about the leadership of those unrecognized republics. You see, it’s that everyone who lives in those unrecognized republics—there are about three million citizens there—they participated in the election campaign, they took to the polls, and that’s why—in the absence of a law on amnesty—they can all be persecuted as separatists. STONE: Three million people at the great risk. So it could turn into another situation like in Serbia, Bosnia? PUTIN: Certainly, that’s what it looks like. We remember the tragedy of what took place in Odessa. More than 40 people—innocent, unarmed—were encircled and burned to death. And those who tried to get away were beaten to death with iron rods. And who was responsible? People adhering to extreme, radical views and such people can enter the territory of these republics and do the same thing there. When I talk about this issue with some of my Western partners, when I’m telling them that mass infringements of human rights can be transpiring there, do you know what they tell me? They ',\n",
       "  'tell me that these people have to go to human rights organizations to seek protection. They have to ask for help—different international organizations. Think of what took place at the trade union building in Odessa and ask yourself who is going to apply to an international organization after the massacre that took place there? STONE: I can’t imagine Russia standing by and watching that happen. PUTIN: Not in the least—certainly not. We are going to help, but we cannot do so unilaterally. Because the key decisions are to be taken by the Kiev authorities. * * * May 11, 2016 STONE: Okay, I’d like to skip forward from 2008 into the Ukraine crisis. We’ve had this discussion before on my first visit, on the terrace, and I’ve listened to it and realized there are things I didn’t ask. And I want to go over it, just to be really clear, because this will be very important to the people who will be watching the documentary or reading this transcript. PUTIN: Certainly. Indeed, it requires a great deal of effort to clarify all that. Because your colleagues, your Western journalists are very talented people. They are capable of convincing people that black is white and vice versa. Just as an example—the tragic events, the assault against South Ossetia—Mr. Saakashvili publicly announced that he ordered his troops to commence that action. One of his dignitaries even spoke on television saying the same thing. I didn’t believe it when I hea',\n",

This is just astounding, this capacity that your American and European journalists can have. You’re all very talented. But when our journalists try to protect Russian national interests, when they take a stance, they are declared immediately the mouthpiece of Kremlin propaganda—much to my chagrin.

STONE: Are you convinced he’s still mad? PUTIN: I have never said that. STONE: I thought you said he was mad? PUTIN: No, I was told by my Western counterparts that he was mad. And I could never afford to say anything like that to my counterpart, either the incumbent or the previous ones. STONE: When’s the last time you saw him? PUTIN: I do not remember. Certainly before the crisis in South Ossetia. STONE: Not after the war, though? PUTIN: No, but on many occasions I said to him, “Mikheil Nikolaevich, please do everything to prevent bloodshed. If you want to restore relations with these parts of Georgia, you have to be very cautious.” These fictions, these divergences, they had a reason a long time ago—not hundreds of years of ago—but back in 1919 when the Russian empire was splitting up. Those parts of Georgia, which incidental',\n",

Back then, those parts declared that they were ready, that they wanted to still be part of Russia. And back then very harsh actions, military measures were employed against them. Local populations still view those actions as genocide and mass elimination of people. In order to surmount all these difficulties, patience was required, as well as certain diplomatic art. STONE: Yeah, I understand. PUTIN: And that was lacking apparently. That’s what the Georgian leadership back then was lacking. Moreover, the current Georgian leadership believe that this action Saakashvili performed was a terrible crime against the Georgian people in the first place, because it has led to very grave consequences. STONE: I was shocked when Shevardnadze—hard name to pronounce—I was shocked because I really respected him as a foreign minister with Gorbachev. You may not agree, but I was shocked when he wanted to join NATO and he became corrupt, I heard. He was a very respected figure in the 1980s. PUTIN: Well, everything passes, everything changes. STONE: That’s true. But just quickly—Obama’s in office now, take it from 2008 to the Ukraine crisis and how this … nothing really major, dramatic happened, as I remember, except for the Snowden affair in 2013. He was offered asylum here in Russia and that upset America. But was there anything e',\n",
       "  'lse in that period that you remember, between you and the US that was exacerbated, was argued about? PUTIN: Well, how can you say that nothing major happened? When President Kuchma’s term came to an end—I do not remember exactly the year—presidential elections took place in Ukraine. And Mr. Yanukovych won that presidential election, but the opposition didn’t like that. And mass riots erupted. These riots were fueled quiet actively by the United States. And a third round of elections was announced—in violation of the country’s constitution. Per se, this can be perceived as a coup d’état. And pro-Western politicians arrived in power after that—Mr. Yushchenko and Timoshenko. I cannot say that I welcomed this way of changing the government. Nowhere is that proper, but in the post-Soviet space, especially, constitutions cannot be broken. Luckily no bloodshed took place there. STONE: Did you have a phone call with Obama about this issue? PUTIN: That was before Obama came to office, and yet we maintained cooperation with the Ukrainian leadership of Mr. Yushchenko and Timoshenko. I went to Kiev, they came back to Moscow. We met in third party countries. And we implemented all our plans of cooperation, but their policy, it was not well-liked by the Ukrainian people. That is why after the presidential term of President Yushchenko ended, Mr. Yanukovych won the election once again and everyone acknowledged that. It was recognized by ',\n",
       "  'everyone. But apparently this was not the best form of government either. Economic difficulties, together with social difficulties, to a great extent had undermined the trust in the new leadership as well. What needed to be done in order to rectify the situation? They should have organized another election. And they should have chosen people with different economic and social views. These people should have made another attempt at arriving back in power. But certainly they should have prevented any escalation to bloodshed, and what’s absolutely certain is that no one should have supported these bloody events. STONE: But you’re talking about 2014—you’re jumping ahead. PUTIN: Yes, in 2014. STONE: But between ’08 and ’14, there was this one election you’re talking about which is in 2012, I think? PUTIN: I do not remember. STONE: There were so many, I mean, the Ukraine to us—we were not paying attention. VP; Yes, well you personally might not have been paying attention, but the CIA was paying a great deal of attention. STONE: I know. It was very confusing. There was a guy with a poisoned face earlier in the century. PUTIN: Yes, you’re talking about Yushchenko—he said that he’d been poisoned during the election campaign. And yet he was elected to office. And he worked and I met with him on many occasions. Why did they need to resort to violence? That’s something I cannot quite understand. Moreover, I talked about that repeated',\n",

STONE: In the crisis, in the final days? PUTIN: Yes and he even agreed to hold early elections. So why do they need to perform this coup d’état? I do not understand. STONE: Okay. So we all remember, I remember you vividly on television saying—I think it was with Charlie Rose, I forgot—but you said there was much evidence and you smiled as you said it. There was much evidence—implying that a thousand eyes were upon this. You know that expression, a thousand eyes were upon this coup. It was a coup in slow motion. It was pretty evident, transparent to the Russians. PUTIN: Certainly. STONE: And you said that on television, but I think the American people find it difficult to understand but, by talking about the evidence and showing it, we might be able to convince the American public that they were being fooled by the Western narrative of events and that there indeed was a coup d’état that went down. PUTIN: That’s very easy to achieve—you simply have to look at the developments. After Yanukovych announced that he had to postpone the signing of the association agreement with the European Union, no one listened to the reasons why, to the terms, to the timetables—mass riots erupted right away after the announcement. These riots led to the seizure of his residence, and on th',\n",

Where are these guarantees? Once the president went to the second largest city of the country to attended a political event, armed men seized the residence of the president. Imagine something like that in the US, if the White House was seized—what would it be called? A coup d’état, or would you say that they have come to sweep the floors. The prosecutor general was shot at. There were so many shootings, so much violence. STONE: I had an interview with Mr. Yanukovych, so I know his version, but it was characterized in the US press as if Yanukovych abandoned Kiev, because he felt the crowd would tear him apart. PUTIN: Yes, that’s the version used to justify the support granted to the coup d’état. Mr. Yanukovych didn’t leave to go abroad. He was in the country when his residence was taken. Moreover, one day afterwards, he used our support and he relocated to the Crimea. Back then, the Crimea was still part of Ukraine. And Yanukovych stayed there for more than 10 days—at least a week in the Crimea, thinking there was still a chance that those people who had put their signatures under the agreement with the opposition would make some attempt, with a view to settling this conflict by civilized, democrat',\n",

Everything can be perverted or distorted, millions of people can be deceived if you have a monopoly on the media. But in the end, I believe for an objective and impartial spectator it’s clear what happened. A coup d’état had taken place. All right, if this coup d’état had made some positive changes … but, on the contrary, the situation deteriorated even further. Ukraine lost territory, not due to Russia’s actions, but due to the choice made by those who are live in Crimea. These people didn’t want to live under the banner of nationalists. A civil war erupted in the southeastern part of Ukraine, in the Donbass. After that, the country witnessed a terrible drop in the GDP. The largest industrial enterprises shut down. Unemployment soared. The real income of the population, their salaries, plunged, inflation hit 45 or 47 percent. And no one knew how to address these issues, or that this would be further exacerbated by an internal political crisis, by a fight between the Prime Minister and the President. In the end, it led to Prime Minister Yatsenyuk resigning. He had actively supported, and had been supported by, the American administration throughout the crises. And what happened next? The European Union opened its borders to Ukraine. It zeroed out the',\n",
       "  ' tariff for Ukrainian goods. But Ukraine’s trade with the European Union decreased by 23 percent, and with Russia it decreased by 50 percent. Ukrainian industrial output is not in high demand in European markets and now they have no access to the Russian market. The agricultural produce that used to be traded successfully in Western Europe is restricted by quotas. And these quotas were introduced by the Europeans. They were exhausted during the first two months after the signing of the agreement. Right now Ukraine is fighting to get a visa-free arrangement for its citizens. Do you know why they are doing that? So they could ensure free exit from the country to find new jobs outside of the country. But the people are once again being tricked, because even if a visa-free deal were granted to Ukraine, that would not enable them to work abroad. STONE: Visa-free to Russia? PUTIN: No, visa-free to the European Union. People heard that they would be able to relocate and work in another country in Europe. There’s something I’d like to tell you. Ukraine has always been an industrialized country as part of the Soviet Union. And right now, a Ukrainian’s dream is to work as a nurse or a gardener or a nanny in a European country amid the complete de-industrialization of the country. Why did they need all that? I simply cannot imagine. STONE: Well, it seems to me what you’re saying is that Russia doesn’t need Ukraine. PUTIN: Russia is ',\n",
       "  'a self-sufficient country. We do not need anyone, but with Ukraine we are connected by thousands of ties. On many occasions I’ve said that and I’d like to reiterate. I’m deeply convinced that the Ukrainian people and the Russian people are not simply close relatives. They are almost the same. As for the language, the culture, the history, each certainly has to be treated with respect. And even when we were one single country, we treated them with respect. Suffice it to say that the whole of the Soviet Union for decades, was managed by those who originated from Ukraine. I think that testifies to a lot. STONE: Yes, but economically, as you say, you’re self-sufficient. They’re gone—let them have their problems. It’s not going to destroy your country. PUTIN: No, certainly—not in the least. STONE: One point you made in our last meeting. I asked, “What about the Russian submarine base in Crimea?” Sebastopol I think it was. And you said it was not important because you have another base across the water—somewhere around here. In other words, you weren’t threatened by the loss of the base. That’s what you told me at the time. PUTIN: Losing the base in Sebastopol was a threat, but it was not too sensitive. Because by that time … right now we are commissioning a new military base—indeed not far from here in Novorossiysk. What was presenting certain difficulties to us was the severing of ties between the companies of the defense sec',\n",
       "  'tor. Because the defense sectors of Ukraine and Russia during the Soviet period were one single system. And if these relations were severed, then that certainly would lead to a certain negative impact on our defense industry. But we have devised a whole system for input-substitution as we call it. And right now, we are actively surmounting all of these difficulties. We are establishing new enterprises from scratch, and these enterprises produce a new generation of military equipment. And that defense industry in Ukraine which used to provide support to Russia is now simply dying out—I’m talking about the missile industry, aircraft industry and also engine construction. STONE: I understand. In other words, the US succeeded in starting the coup, and winning as they did many times over the years. And it was a loss, but not a fatal loss. PUTIN: You could say that. Moreover, when I say that we started establishing new enterprises that help propel us to new technological levels, I often cite this example. All of our helicopters used to be equipped with engines produced in Ukraine—100% of our helicopters. Once the supplies from Ukraine stopped, we built a new plant, right now we are completing another one. All helicopters can fly—fully functional—and we have engines of a new generation. So as you can see, what our air force is doing in Syria testifies to the fact that we are doing quite well. STONE: Even if NATO entered into an ',\n",
       "  'agreement with Ukraine, I still don’t see too much of a threat, with the new weaponry. PUTIN: I see a threat. This threat consists of the fact that once NATO comes to this or that country, then as a whole the political leadership of that country, as well as the population there, cannot influence the decisions NATO makes—including the decisions related to stationing the military infrastructure. Even very sensitive weapons systems can be deployed. I’m talking also about the antiballistic missile systems. And that means that we would have to respond somehow to that. STONE: Plus all the weapons we’ve put into the Baltic States? PUTIN: I’m talking about this strategic anti-ballistic missile system (ABMs). There are only two facilities like that in Eastern Europe—in Romania and in Poland. And at sea in the Mediterranean, there are plans to deploy these systems on ships. Right now negotiations are under way to do the same in South Korea. All that certainly creates a threat to our nuclear deterrence system. Let me remind you that I myself proposed to our American partners that we should work on these systems together. What would that imply? That would imply that we would designate the missile threats together, and we would create a joint system for ABM management. Then we would exchange technological information. And all of that in my view would spell cardinal drastic changes in the world as far as national security is concerned.',\n",
       "  ' I’m not going into details right now. But our proposal was declined by our American counterparts, [as I’ve said many times]. STONE: Of course. Okay. But it seems to me that Russia adapts and you are adapting to these ABMs. Am I wrong? PUTIN: We have these capabilities, we are improving them, and when we talked with our American counterparts, we told them that we deemed the construction of those systems as a threat, and they always responded that this was not against us. This was against the missile aspirations of Iran. As of now an agreement has been reached, fortunately, with Iran. But the deployment of this system still goes forward. What does it tell us? We were right. But back then when we were discussing that, we were saying we would have to take actions in response, and these actions were to partly consist in improving our offensive capabilities. Their response was as follows. The ABM system they told us was not established against us. And what we were going to do—that is, to improve our own offensive capability—would be considered by the United States as not aimed against the United States. And we agreed on that. STONE: You know, the American Indians made treaties with the US government and they were the first to experience the treachery of the US government. You’re not the first. PUTIN: We wouldn’t like to be the last. [laughter] STONE: In that regard, I’d like to show you a piece of film from Stanley Kubrick’s “',\n",
       "  'Dr. Strangelove” set in the war rooms of the United States. One scene we can see and then if you like we can see another one. But first, to just finish this Ukraine thing. My ultimate question is, in hindsight, looking back, did you make a mistake by annexing Crimea because it cost you tremendously—the sanctions, the whole EU turns on Russia, the US—it becomes big news because it’s regarded as illegal in the international post-war treaty world. Not to say that other people haven’t broken their treaties, but … Anyway, it did cost you big time and you perhaps miscalculated. Perhaps you thought it would be acceptable in some way. Have you ever thought about that decision in retrospect? PUTIN: We did not force Crimea into Russia. Those who live in Crimea have decided to join Russia. And when following this path we were very cautious, and in full compliance with international law and the United Nations charter. The first thing that was done in Crimea itself was not by us, but by those who inhabit Crimea. The legitimate parliament of Crimea that was elected based on the Ukrainian legislation, announced a referendum. The Crimean parliament, by an overwhelming vote, decided, after the referendum, to join Russia. I know of no other way that would be more democratic to address issues of this kind than the free will of the people. The expression of this free will, was that an overwhelming majority had voted for independence and for ',\n",
       "  'joining Russia. On the whole, during the referendum, it was 90 percent or even more. If there is a better or more democratic way to address this issue, please tell me about that. Today, I hear only the opinion that contains the attempt at justifying that our actions, with regard to Crimea, were not correct. That is, the central authorities of Ukraine did not agree to that. That’s what they argue. But let me remind you that when a decision on Kosovo’s independence was taken, the United Nations International Court of Justice decided that on issues related to independence and self-determination, no consent from the central authorities of this or that country were required. And please say for those who will see this film [or read this transcript], that the letter from the State Department of the United States addressed to the UN Security Council on this matter says the State Department supports Kosovo’s decision on independence wholeheartedly. Other European countries spoke in the same vein. And in this regard I do not quite understand why the Kosovars would have these rights, whereas Russians, Ukrainians, and Crimean Tatars who live in Crimea in a similar situation would not enjoy the same rights. I think that is absolutely unacceptable. That is what we call having double standards. And we do not regret anything. This is not just about the future of Soviet territories.

       "  'd we didn’t have a choice, really. Only one decision was possible—to agree with this request from the Crimeans about the reunification with Russia. Just one more thing—our troops were there. But these troops didn’t take a single shot. The only thing they did was to create conditions for these elections to take place and for the referendum to take place. And I reiterate, even though I said that on many occasions, in the course of these events there was not a single victim. STONE: Let me put it this way—did you expect to be excommunicated by the European community because of this? PUTIN: Certainly I did expect this kind of reaction. But before making this decision, we had conducted a very deep social research in Russia, and the overwhelming majority of Russian citizens—around 80 percent or more—when responding to the question whether it was possible to re-unify Crimea with Russia, even though that would mean a deterioration of relations with the West and other countries of the world, they said yes they thought it was possible. So when making this decision, I was guided not by the preferences of my counterparts from other countries. I responded to the sentiment of the Russian people. STONE: And the Crimeans as of this date, are they grateful? Or are they pissed off? VP; There are many problems in Crimea, but on the whole, people support the decision which was taken. The best estimate of that support was the poll that was rec',\n",

The overwhelming majority—I’m talking about the same figures—the overwhelming majority re-affirmed the decision they had made earlier on joining Russia. STONE: And Donbass? Well, this is a real problem, I guess, in terms of the thorn that doesn’t go away. How do you get out of this one? PUTIN: Certainly, I think the Minsk Agreement has to be implemented. STONE: But it doesn’t seem like Kiev has any intention of doing so. PUTIN: I do have all the plans, and the Russian leadership as a whole, we have these plans. But the key components of the Minsk agreements are the political components, and the main political component is to make amendments to the Ukrainian constitution. It should have been done, not by us, but by the Kiev authorities, by the end of 2015. And a law on amnesty has to be adopted and it has to have force. It has been adopted, but it has not been promulgated by the president. A special status law in these territories has to be enforced. This law has also been adopted. It has been voted on by the Ukrainian parliament but it has not been enforced. We cannot do that for them. But I’m hopeful that in the end this is going to be done. And the conflict is going to end.

His first film assignment came in 1961 (Il federale, by director Luciano Salce, with whom Morricone had worked in the Italian theater). In addition to Leone, Morricone began to work with some of the greatest directors of European cinema, among them Pier Paolo Pasolini (Uccellacci e Uccellini, 1965, and Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom',\n",

Morricone remained the composer of choice for Sergio Leone. His scores for the director’s Once Upon a Time in the West (1969), Duck, You Sucker (1971) and Once Upon a Time in America (1984) and, with Leone as producer, My Name Is Nobody (1973), were remarkable\\xa0for their inventiveness and color.

In the cinema, the music is conditioned by the images and by the direction of the director, and therefore is complementary to the film. This does not mean that film music is not worthwhile. It always depends on who’s writing it. It’s not seriously considered because there is a grave infiltration, throughout the entire world, including America, of amateurs and dilettantes, people who do not know music. Therefore, this lowers the level of the profession, and film music is not considered a serious art form. Cineaste: Wh',\n",

For example, some influential directors contractually negotiate for the right of final cut. Is it not possible for a composer of your international stature and reputation to insist on some level of creative control? For example, how often are you able to participate in the final mix? Morricone: This is the first time I’ve ever been asked this question. You have to remember that the director is the principal creative force in the making of the film. I have sometimes been involved in the shifting of the music from one point to another in the film—it’s good for the film and ',\n",

Many times after I do the recording I’ll give them the same kind of suggestions, that they should shift the music here or there. Since the relationship between a director and a composer is one of faith, of trust, this happens with no trauma. However, you have to remember what I said at the beginning, OK?

Notwithstanding this, I do not believe that the director should accept a contractual clause whereby he is constrained by the composer’s decisions. Cineaste: How often has the score that you’ve written and recorded been dubbed into the picture to your satisfaction? Morricone: Almost always. What doesn’t satisfy me is that you don’t always hear the music as much as I would like. Cineaste: Dots that happen often? Morricone: Sometimes. Cineaste: Can you exercise any control over that aspect?  Morricone: I give general opinions to the directors. I tell them that a human being cannot de',\n",

If a director mixes in the general sound column the dialog and the sound effects as well as the music, the human ear cannot distinguish the music. What one hears is a very confused kind of noise. It would be wonderful if the music had only one more element combined with it. I recommend this to the directors. Not so much for me, but for the clarity of the film, so that the public will understand it. But I can only suggest this to the director. Anything more would seem as if I were thinking only of myself and not of the film. Cineaste: How d',\n",

Among directors, he is one of my best friends. Therefore, when he says something I don’t like, I tell him very clearly. And I must say that he respects my opinions. Cineaste: Do you prefer to have detailed discussions with a film’s director about the type of score he may be looking for, or would you prefer simply to be left to your own devices? Morricone: When a director calls me, he already knows what I can give him. so he recognizes in me a certain homogenity of ideas. I then have to reflect freely on the proj',\n",

Sometimes our discussion ends right away, because we agree immediately. Sometimes I have to convince the director that 1 don’t like his idea, or he has to convince me that he doesn’t like my idea, and sometimes we find a compromise. Cineaste: For most films, does an audience need a melody to hear and retain? And, if so, does that limit your creative choices? Morricone: When it is necessary, it is good to have a melodic theme. But when do we do them? This is the problem. The public and many times even the director',\n",
       "  ' demand a melody, especially when there are some very expressive scenes that require it. This does not mean that we cannot do a film without a melody, but the public seems to expect a melodic line every time there is an expression of sentimentality. Personally, I can do without a melodic theme. In fact, in many cases I have tried to disguise the melodic theme within rests, pauses, and silence, and to encourage the public to identify those sentimental sensations with musical colors instead of a theme. Unfortunately, even though I’ve conducted many experiments along these lines, the public still wants to hear a melody. Cineaste: Why do you always orchestrate your own scores? Do you believe that com',\n",
       "  'posers who do not orchestrate are shortchanging either the music or the film? Morricone: I don’t want to get into delicate professional questions. However, I will make a simple declaration. Composers in all epochs and all ages, except perhaps this one, for film and other contemporary musical practices, have always written out their own music. I cannot understand why one who calls himself a composer does not finish his own music, and thereby give the final and definitive touch to his composition. This stems from the era of musical theater, where composers hired arrangers to write out the music because either they did not know how, or were too lazy, or because of the excessive workload. Throughout ',\n",
       "  'the history of music, no composer has had his score written out by someone else. So why does this occur in film music? I do not understand. Cineaste: Would you comment on your use of unusual sound choices—such as whistling, vocal or electronic effects—notably in the early films with Sergio Leone?  Morricone: Many believe that those were special effects. They seemed to be right, however, and therefore I put them in. After all, whistling comes out of the human body and is like the voice; it is not a special effect. In fact, it is a sound between the voice and the flute, or perhaps the piccolo. And since it comes out of the body, it is a very natural sound. I do not believe I have used any special k',\n",
       "  'inds of instruments—except, in certain cases, the church organ, which, since nobody else had used it. was probably considered a special effect. Cineaste: You use the human voice, both solo and in choruses, far more than most composers. Why? Is it a humanizing touch for music that might otherwise seem cool? Morricone: The human voice is at the disposal of all composers. Why don’t others use it? I love the human voice, because it is an extraordinary instrument. It doesn’t go through a piece of wood or metal, it comes directly out of the body and can be the most expressive and malleable instrument. It can react in many strange ways. First, I used the human voice because I love it; and second, I used',\n",

[He alludes to Edda Dell’Orso, whose remarkable voice can be heard in several of the Leone films and other Morricone scores—ed.] And during the period we are referring to, I used that particular voice often because I really liked it. So I became known as someone who uses the human voice all the time. Perhaps it’s true, but everyone can use the voice. It’s at every composer’s disposal. Cineaste: You have been known to incorporate references to classical works, including Mozart and Beethoven, in some of your scores. Is this a matter of making the music fun, either for you or for your more musically knowledgeable listeners? Morricone: I have mad',\n",
       "  'e some very brief references at times. They are only brief references, as if for a moment you become very eccentric, but it’s not as if it was necessary or important to the piece at hand. I wanted to do it because it was fun. And I’ve always done it when I’ve composed a piece in collage form. At a certain point. I just throw in a reference—for example, a bit of Mozart—which is a minute piece of the composition. It works as a whole for the reason that the composition itself is not a homogeneous piece. Cineaste: It’s said that today you turn down more than half of the film projects offered to you. What criteria do you use in deciding which projects to accept? Morricone: If I like the director, if I',\n",
       "  ' have esteem for him. that helps me to decide. And if it’s a director I’ve worked with before, and worked well with, this is a preference. I never decide after having seen a film, I decide before because professionally it’s not correct to assume a critical position to accept or refuse after having seen the work. Besides, when I see a film it’s not finished yet, so it doesn’t have all of its elements. Therefore, my refusals are really for works that I cannot do simply because I don’t have the time. Since I do all my own orchestrations—I have no help, I don’t want and have never had anybody else’s help—I have very limited time to complete work. Therefore I have to analyze my time. Cineaste: When ch',\n",
       "  'oosing your films, is the subject matter also important, or the prospect of solving interesting dramatic problems with music? Morricone: Both of those considerations are important, but I must also explain that, for me, writing music is a very joyous experience. I love writing music and, therefore, I love this profession. More than anything, the selection is guided by this love to write. In addition, there is the joy of surmounting the difficulties and those requests made by the director. Tackling these requests, even though they are sometimes strange, offers the greatest satisfaction once achieved. One of the pleasures of this profession, in fact, is to address and meet the conditions set by the ',\n",
       "  'director. Cineaste: Once you’ve chosen a project, do you write music based on an emotional reaction to the visuals, or is it more of an intellectual exercise? Morricone: Both things, absolutely. The composer must let himself go, as a member of the public, not as a critic, and must be guided by his emotions. After this, he intervenes technically and therefore also intellectually, as well as with his artistic abilities. First, however, he must let himself go, and. then, on the wave of letting go, react to the images, and then he responds in a musically expressive manner. Cineaste: What is the average length of time you are given to write and record a film score? A common complaint among many film c',\n",
       "  'omposers is that they could write better scores if they had more time. Do you agree with that or do you find the pressure of a short schedule to be a creative stimulant? Morricone: In asking the question you’ve already answered everything. Usually they give me the time I need. I never had to complain about too short a schedule because I always ask for the time I need. Cineaste: How much time is that? Morricone: Usually a month and a half, and they give it to me because they know I need it. When I didn’t have the time I needed, the score that I wrote in a very short time was not better than the one that I had four months to write. Cineaste: Was it worse?

You have to remember that, for a film, the work has to be precise and directed toward the spectator, so too many mediations of resolution of a scientific and mathematical nature in the composition could be negative. With more time, then, the composer could be carried away with his taste for this elaboration and arrive at a composition that is perhaps on a slightly more superior level but one that is more difficult for the spectator. Enrico de Melis [friend of Morricone]: But there’s a very important factor you should talk about. Contrary to ',\n",

Cineaste: How often do you compose before seeing a final cut? Morricone: Almost always, because when I view the film it is not in its final form.

Morricone: It’s definitely a cliché. Music does not descend from the skies.

Let’s say that the general result, whether from inspiration or technical preparation, comes through many interactions between various components, and all these influences determine the final product. Cineaste: You are probably most widely known for your early scores for the Sergio Leone Westerns. Most people are unaware, however, that many of those scores were written before the filming was done. That’s a complete reversal of the usual production procedure. Leone said, in fact, that for those films the music was as important as the dialog.  Morricone: Leone first called me because he had heard my music for two other Italian-Spanish Westerns. He’d he',\n",
       "  'ard an arrangement I’d done for a song, and he wanted that arrangement for A Fistful of Dollars. It was an atmosphere to which we later added the theme, and the whistle, and so on. Then, in the following films, Leone granted a greater importance to the use of the music than most other directors. For him. music really was as important as dialog and all the other components. Therefore, he felt it was important to ask me to write the music before he shot the film. Cineaste: I’ve heard he actually filmed scenes as the music was played?  Morricone: Yes. He had a recording of an arrangement of the music which he played on the set. Cineaste: Do you find that, as with Leone. European directors are more w',\n",
       "  'illing than American directors to let the music assume a more prominent role? Morricone: No, not at all. I do not think that Leone gave more possibilities to work within the film than other directors. It stems primarily from Leone’s style, which allowed more time, more space, for music than that of other directors. It wasn’t because of our friendship; it was strictly his particular style. For Leone, music was a very dramatic and expressive element, and, because of this, he allowed the right amount of time and space for music. If other directors do not do this, that’s OK. Again, it depends upon the personal style of the director. Cineaste: Your collaborations with Leone had an enormous impact on w',\n",
       "  'orld cinema and on film music. Did you recognize it at the time and how do you assess their impact now? Morricone: As I said before, Leone allowed a lot more time and space for music; that was his stylistic choice. And since there was more music, people heard more music. And if they heard more music, they noticed it more. And if they noticed it more, they were able to assimilate it more. This is a sign that is very important to a composer, because now he finds himself collaborating on a more intense level and his music becomes an integral part of the film itself. I will make a very simple, paradoxical statement. If a director gives a composer ten seconds of time, he cannot be heard and therefore ',\n",
       "  'cannot collaborate with the director. However, if a director gives ten minutes of time, the composer can express himself properly. If the ten minutes that you have been given can be heard, and it is not drowned out by either the dialog between the characters or the special effects and action—which distracts the public from the music —then the music will be appreciated. However, if in those ten minutes you cannot even begin to hear any musical expression, because of the dialog or action taking place at the same time, the music is completely destroyed. Therefore, ten seconds of music, if it can be heard, is a far better collaboration between director and composer than ten minutes of music which has',\n",
       "  ' been stifled by other factors within the film. The final decision of whether to hear the music or not remains in the hands of the director. If the director believes that the music serves a function as a dramatic and expressive form, then the music will be heard; if not, then it will not be heard. This is not a fault; we must always keep in mind Sergio Leone as the central character in this question. Cineaste: The Mission was a great favorite in this country. What was it about that film that inspired you, and can you speak about your choices, including the use of a choir and indigenous South American instruments?

Cineaste: How important is it, in your view, that a score for a historical film attempt to be authentic in terms of the use of original instruments or a re creation of the musical style of the era? For example, how extensive was your research for films such as Moses and Marco Polo, which involved ancient Jewish music and Oriental music. Morricone: In general, I don’t have the original instruments nor the people who can play them, and sometimes I don’t think I’m even interested in that regard. I use instruments which give the ',\n",

Even today Gregorian chant is an emanation of the Greek and Hebrew, so all of this brought about the results of Moses and Marco Polo.

I left before it was finished. In America they don’t care about the music on TV, all they care about is the dialog.

Not all TV programs are alike. A program of artistic merit, like Marco Polo, which has nothing to do with the usual commercial work, was reduced on American TV to a very low level of pure discussion between actors.

Sometimes a critic ventures to say that there’s too much music, or that it’s too loud, or that there’s too little music, or too much beautiful music, and when they want to talk about it they use a single adjective.

Morricone: Certainly, more attention to film music on the part of critics wouldn’t be a bad idea, it would be welcome. But you can’t ask for this.

Pauline Kael: When I was a teenage philosophy student at Berkeley, my friends and I were devoted to James Agee because he was the only movie critic who spoke to us.

They didn’t react personally to what was on the screen; they filtered the movies through a set of ideas. I tried in most of my West Coast pieces to differentiate myself from them.

Kael: Leslie Fiedler once said something like “A critic is an artist or he is nothing.” I’ve always thought of criticism as a branch of writing, and, if you don’t honor the readers enough to write your very damned best, you’re insulting them and you’re insulting the work you’re dealing with. Cineaste: Were there other critical models besides Agee? Kael: He was the dominant one for films. I felt an excitement reading Agee.

I also read people who were critics for a brief period, or who had an unusual slant, like Cecilia Ager and Vachel Lindsay and Robert Warshow, and who sometimes did wonderful pieces on film. I was more influenced, though, by literary critics, such as R.P. Blackmur. But I think it was more my friends’ reactions and arguing with them about movies that got me interested—friends such as Robert Duncan, the poet, and another poet, Robert Horan.

Contemporary theorists—feminist and deconstructivist—seem even more obfuscatory. So often the theories that are promoted are a way for professors to show off and be idolized by their students.

Kael: I didn’t aim it at any particular audience. Anybody who wants to read it, can. I wrote the same way for McCall’s as for The New Yorker, and I always tried to be as direct and plain as I could be.

When William Shawn first talked to me about writing for him I was dubious because of the swank look; the ads and the whole silky texture of the magazine was a real turn-off. I gradually talked myself into it, and was happy that I did. Cineaste: Do you see the rise of independent American film as a genuine alternative to Hollywood?

The Front never came close to what we saw in the press, which was that the blacklisted writers looked like Woody Allen and the men who fronted for them looked handsome and distinguished.

Kael: I don’t know what you mean by “intrude.” The movie was popular with people partly because of its right-wing attitude, but they didn’t necessarily recognize it as right wing. Certainly most of the press didn’t, not when it first came out. I felt it necessary to treat it as a political work because its politics offended me. Eastwood’s films are right wing in a way that doesn’t get analyzed because they’re not explicitly so. I’m amazed at the number of critics who let his attitudes slide right by them.

Kael: I loved Altman’s work, but I was never close to him personally. I’ve met him only a few times. He’s a great risk-taking director, and McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Nashville are superb films.

There was a naive streak in a lot of what he did. I liked Shadows, but felt that he got into a trap with the films he made with Ben Gazzara and Peter Falk.

Or, to look back, the way that Debra Winger could be piercing. Movies give us presents: people like Judy Davis, a wizard at conveying neurosis and making it witty.

As he got older, I didn’t respond to his movies in the same way. They simply weren’t for me. Bresson is the only director who made a film (Diary of a Country Priest) that put me to sleep twice.

Directors such as Wyler and Hitchcock who lasted for decades had a studio system supporting them. These guys had to pull it all out of themselves. It’s miraculous, really, what they did.

Still, if you have three or four great films to your credit, you shouldn’t be called a failure.

The kids who said “Wow!” when they came out of a movie and couldn’t say any more were expressing some deep feeling. The kids who come out of Twister may say “Wow!” but it isn’t the same “Wow!” It’s a special-effects “Wow!” This doesn’t mean that movies are finished; it means they’re changing.

But now there’s a real simpleton’s morality that he hands the audience, like when you hear him on television saying that everyone should be forced to see Schindler’s List.

Directors or actors do often say horrible things about a critic in print or on TV and then they may take the critic aside and try to square themselves.

Leone’s father worked in movies, and the boy literally grew up in the studio. All his movies are dream-plays. They derive from movies, and he didn’t seem to have any experience outside of movies and studio life. So his movies are visions sustained from childhood of Hollywood’s version of America.

Kael: They sometimes make a smashing beginning and you think they’re going to have a great career, but they lack the experience, the point of view, and the taste. They haven’t read enough or seen enough of the other arts to grow as moviemakers. Movies by themselves are not enough of an education. Leone breathed a kind of visionary poetry into his epics, but most of the American film-school kids have a hard time projecting a strong enough vision to make their movies cohere.

They’re more beautiful than the people we see in life, and they give us standards of beauty and feeling. Their emotions transform us.

       "[['Oliver Stone conducted interviews with Vladimir Putin on four separate trips to Russia for a total of nine days between July 2, 2015 and February 10, 2017. The following is a selection of parts of the interviews where Putin talks about Ukraine. * * * July 4, 2015 STONE: Okay, Ukraine. I want to say first of all that I interviewed Mr. Yanukovych here in Moscow a few months ago. And he told me his version of events. PUTIN: The thing is, here is an objective sequence of events. These events can be assessed differently, and you can name these events using different words, different formulas. But it’s quite evident you can follow what was happening day after day. And then you can give the people a chance to make an assessment of their own of what has really happened. STONE: Well, I would like your perspective on it from November to February 20th, 2013 into 2014. During those three months, there was quite a bit of protest in Ukraine. You must have been aware of it. PUTIN: Do you want to know what was happening in Ukraine starting from the early 1990s? What was happening there was the systemic robbery of the Ukrainian people. Right away after independence, Ukraine started an even wilder privatization and robbery of state property, which led to the deterioration of the standard of living—right after Ukraine gained independence. Whatever powers came into force, nothing changed for the lives of ordinary people. And certainly the people were fed up with all those arbitrary actions and that crazy corruption, the impoverishment and the illegal enrichment of other people. That was the root of the discontent the people were feeling. And certainly people were thinking that exiting in any way to the EU would liberate them from the terrible conditions they had found themselves in starting from the beginning of the 1990s. I think that was the driving force behind the developments in Ukraine. And the crisis was sparked, as is well known, when President Yanukovych said he had to postpone the signing of the association agreement with the European Union. That was the starting point. And our partners in Europe and the United States managed to mount this',\n",
       "  ' horse of discontent of the people. And instead of trying to find out what was really happening, they decided to support the coup d’état. And now let me tell you how it unfolded and what our position was. Mr. Yanukovych announced that he had to postpone, not cancel, the signing of the association agreement with the European Union because, at that moment, Ukraine had already been a member of the Free Trade Area of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States). Ukraine itself was the engine behind the establishment of the free trade area in the CIS space. And it was the force that led to the creation of this zone. As a result of this, and the fact that the economies of Russia and Ukraine were emerging as a united economy and had unique economic relations, many of our enterprises could not exist independently. There was very deep co-operation between those enterprises. The markets of Russia were absolutely open to imports from Ukraine. We had and still have a zero tariff barrier. We have a single energy system and a single transportation system. There are many other elements which bring our economies together. For 17 years we have been in negotiations with the European Union on the conditions of Russia’s accession to the WTO, and all of a sudden, it was announced to us that Ukraine and the EU were signing an association agreement. And that meant the opening up of the Ukrainian markets. It meant that the technical standards and trade regulation and other elements of the economic policy of the EU were to be implemented in Ukraine, and that was happening very fast without a transition period. At the same time, our customs border with Ukraine was absolutely open. And the EU was able to enter our territory with all of their goods without any negotiations, despite the agreements—principled agreements—which we had reached with them before, during those 17-year talks on our accession to the WTO. Certainly we had to respond to that. And we said that if Ukraine had decided to act like that it was its choice. And we respected that choice. But this didn’t mean that we had to pay for that choice. Why do people living in Russia today have to pay f',\n",
       "  'or this choice the Ukrainian leadership has made? That’s why we told them that we would have to take protective measures, and those protected measures were nothing special and they were not discriminatory. We were just trying to extend the regular trade regime to the territory of Ukraine which in international private law is called most favored nation status. So we’re just going to withdraw the preferences. But without preferences, the Ukrainian enterprises would not exist too long in the Russian market. And we proposed that we hold talks with our European partners in a trilateral format. But there was a flat refusal. They told us that we had better stay out of it. They told us, if we are talking to Canada, you would not interfere, right? If you are in talks with China, we are not interfering with those talks—that’s what they told us. And they asked us not to interfere in their relations with Ukraine. And we said, those situations are quite different—Canada, China, and Russia/Ukrainian relations—these are different stories. But we told them, if you think like that then we’re not going to interfere. But in that case, we ask them to respect our right to undertake protective measures and to continue this economic policy. I would go even further, talking about the economics, and after the coup d’état, after the leadership changed in Ukraine, and Mr. Poroshenko arrived in power, at the request of our American partners and the request of the Ukrainian side, we did not implement protective measures. Whereas the Ukrainian leadership signed the association agreement with the European Union. And they ratified this agreement, and after that they postponed that agreement from entering into force until January 1st, 2016. So you’re now shooting this documentary in mid-2015, and as of now, this association agreement between Ukraine and the EU has not yet entered into force. That’s exactly what I had proposed to Mr. Yanukovych. He had proposed that the signing should be postponed. So the question is what was the reason for the coup d’état? Why did they drive this country into chaos, into civil war? So what was the sense behind all that? And now ',\n",
       "  'as to the unfolding of the political situation, indeed you have now mentioned the fact that there were riots and a coup d’état was perpetrated. Let me remind you that before that, on February 21st, 2014, if my memory serves me correctly, three foreign ministers from European countries arrived in Kiev. They took part in the meeting between President Yanukovych and the opposition, and they agreed that early elections were to be held. They agreed on the future of relations between the president and the opposition. And the following day, President Yanukovych went to the second largest city of Ukraine, Kharkov—he went there to participate in a regional conference. And once he departed, his residence was seized, his administration was seized, and the government was seized as well with the use of force. What would you call that? And the Prosecutor General was shot at, one of his security officers was wounded. And the motorcade of President Yanukovych himself was shot at. So it’s nothing more than an armed seizure of power. Naturally, someone supported this coup d’état. Where I started from this—not just personally against Yanukovych, but against the government itself because people were fed up with the chaos of what was happening. The poverty, they were fed up with it, as well as with corruption. After power was seized, some people liked it. But others didn’t like it. People were frightened by this surge of nationalism, radicalism. The first thing the newly-arrived in power started to talk about was the need to adopt a law limiting the use of the Russian language. The Europeans prevented them from doing that. But the signal had already been sent to society, and people understood the direction the country was moving towards in such places as Crimea, where the overwhelming majority of people are Russians by nationality. Whereas Ukrainians who live in those places, as a whole, believe their native language to be the Russian language. Certainly, people in Crimea were especially frightened by this situation. Furthermore there were threats made against them directly. And all that led to the circumstances which are well known. I’ve elaborated ',\n",
       "  'on them on many occasions, so if you are interested, I can repeat. But something like that started to happen in the southeastern part of Ukraine on the whole. In the territory which is called Donbass, there are two large cities, and people didn’t accept the coup d’état there either. First there were attempts at arresting them using the police, but the police defected to their side quite quickly. Then the central authorities started to use special forces and in the night people were snatched and taken to prison. And afterwards there was the tragedy in Odessa. And people who were unarmed took to the streets for peaceful protests and they were pushed into a building and were massacred atrociously. Even pregnant women. That is a catastrophe. But still no one is going to investigate it. Certainly not people in Donbass. After that they took up arms. But once hostilities started, instead of engaging in a dialogue with people in the southeast part of Ukraine, after they used Special Forces, they started to use weapons directly—tanks and even military aircraft. There were strikes from the multiple rocket launchers against residential neighborhoods. We repeatedly appealed to the new leadership of Ukraine, asking them to abstain from extreme actions. They started hostilities once, they were put to rout, they stopped, then elections took place, then this new president arrived in power. I talked to him [Poroshenko] on many occasions. I tried to persuade him not to resume hostilities. And he had an opinion of his own about what was happening. He always referred to the losses his forces had sustained to two or three as people during the hostilities with the militia. Certainly that was a tragedy. It is always sad when people die. But when he resumed the hostilities, thousands of people died. And the official forces suffered another defeat. Then they started hostilities for the third time. And once again they were defeated. After that, the latest Minsk Agreements were signed. They agreed that these agreements would be adhered to by both parties. Unfortunately, we’re not witnessing that, and I think the official authorities in Kiev are not willing',\n",
       "  ' to engage in any direct dialogue with Donbass. They refuse to be engaged in direct dialogue. Up to now. All the provisions of the Minsk agreements stipulate directly that issues related to amendments to the Constitution, issues related to the adoption of the law, on municipal elections, issues related to this special status of Donbass—all these issues have to be coordinated, that’s what it says. But nothing like that is happening. Right now, the Kiev authorities are trying to make amendments to the Constitution. But according to the information I have—just yesterday I received new information—there is no contact, no negotiations with Donbass. Moreover, the Minsk agreements say directly that the law which had already been adopted by the Verkhovna Rada should enter into force. This is along with the special status of Donbass. Unfortunately, just several days ago President Poroshenko announced that no special status would be granted to Donbass. I have to talk to him. I have to understand what it means. Does it mean that the Kiev authorities refuse to adhere to the Minsk agreements? There are other considerations at work here. One of the provisions of the Minsk agreements says that it’s necessary to adopt a law on amnesty. But the law has not been adopted yet. How can you talk to people in Donbass who are threatened with criminal prosecution? Another provision—the economy and the social sphere of Donbass have to be restored. But instead the authorities are strengthening the blockade of these territories. And all things boiled down to one thing—they are saying that Donbass is fighting against them and that’s why they’re not going to pay them anything. And I say there are pensioners who are entitled, according to the law of Ukraine, to a pension, that there are people with disabilities who are not fighting anyone. They are just victims of this situation—hostages. I asked them, “Do you consider them to be citizens of your country? Well in that case you have to take care of them.” Their response was quite simple—“We do not have money and we’re not going to pay them anything.” We are supplying energy. Ukraine has refused to pay for that ',\n",
       "  'energy. So on the whole, it’s a full-fledged, very tough blockade. Many people criticize Israel for the blockade of Palestine. I’m not going to elaborate on that, I’m not going to talk about that because it’s a different story entirely. But the same thing is happening here and everyone seems not to notice what is happening. There is not enough food there, not enough medicine. Nothing. And that is a serious issue. We assume that there is no other way to find a solution to this issue, other than adhering to the Minsk agreements—they have to be implemented. We always hear appeals that we have to influence somehow the leadership of these unrecognized republics. Just recently, the leaders of these republics announced publicly that they were willing to go back to the Ukrainian state under certain conditions—if the Minsk agreements were observed. But these agreements were not implemented. And Donbass is not to blame for that. Let me reiterate, I believe that there is no other way to settle this crisis. And the Minsk agreement is the only way toward that end. STONE: Well, obviously there are problems with it. What if the people in Donbass came across the border to Russia? That would be their only hope if things got really bad. PUTIN: Do you mean that the best way to solve this issue is to push these people from their homeland? STONE: I’m not saying that, I’m saying if they have no water, no food, and they can’t go on living, the only way you can travel is on your feet. I mean we’re talking about major migration. PUTIN: Yes, many people have already resorted to these means—two and a half million Ukrainian citizens are in Russia. The overwhelming majority of them are men who are under conscription. They’re eligible for conscription. But in these territories there used to be four and a half million people. Right now estimates are around three million people are left there. STONE: So what if they come? PUTIN: Well, they are already doing that. They are coming. But once the situation quiets down, they go back to their homes. STONE: Yes, I understand. Of course the Kiev government would claim that the Russian army or the Russian government has',\n",
       "  ' intervened already in Ukraine with the annexation of Crimea. And the troops—they’re saying there are paratroopers or whatever you want to call them, contractors, soldiers and arms dealers helping them or helping the separatists. PUTIN: As to Crimea, I’d like to ask you, what is democracy? Democracy is a policy which is based on the will of the people. And how do we know the will of the people? In a modern world we use the voting procedure. People came to a referendum and there were no whips, no machine guns. And you cannot use these means to make a person come to a polling station to vote. People came, the turnout was more than 90 percent. And more than 90 percent voted in favor of re-unifying with Russia. The choice of the people has to be respected. And you cannot try to conform international law to your political interests against the principles of democracy. STONE: Nonetheless, the United States would say that you have violated international law—and that’s been a theme that has been repeated again and again by the EU. And you yourself acknowledged that the US had done that in Iraq, so it’s a question of course, at the end of the day, of power, isn’t it? PUTIN: Yes, that’s correct. As to armed forces of the United States coming to Iraq. And there were no elections there. No elections were held. As to Crimea, yes, we created conditions for people to be able to come to polling stations. But we were not engaged in any hostilities there, no one was shooting there, no one was killed. STONE: But literally the US would argue that elections were held eventually in Iraq. PUTIN: In the end, yes, but before that there was a war. And there was no war in Crimea. That’s the first thing. Secondly, there is another criticism addressed to Russia. They are saying that international law was violated. I have already talked about that but I’d like to emphasize that in the course of the Kosovo crisis, the International Court of Justice considered very cautiously this situation and the ICJ arrived at a conclusion saying that when the issue of self-determination of a nation is concerned, in accordance with Point Two of the United Nations charter, if',\n",
       "  ' my memory serves me correctly, the concerns of the central authorities of this or that country on this matter are not required. And thirdly, since you are preparing this documentary and you have time, I’d like to ask you to do something—have a look at what was said on that matter by the representatives of the United States, and the representatives of certain European countries—Germany, Great Britain—what they said in those matters when they were talking about them with the ICJ. All of them were saying that no consent from Belgrade was needed, and they were saying that everything was done in accordance with the United Nations Charter. I was always wondering if Kosovars were allowed to do it, why is that not allowed to Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, and Crimeans? There is no difference whatsoever. Moreover, the decision on the independence of Kosovo was adopted by the decision of the parliament. Whereas, in Crimea first the parliament voted in favor of independence, and afterwards they held a referendum and during that referendum the people said that they were willing to go back to Russia. Every step has a reason behind it. STONE: Was there any UN condemnation of the annexation of Crimea? PUTIN: No, I don’t know anything of that. STONE: Can we talk a little bit about the airplane that was shot down in July—the Malaysian Airliner [MH17]? PUTIN: Yes, certainly. STONE: Thank you. I’ve heard both sides. I know Russian intelligence has claimed there were two planes in the air, or at least two planes, and there was a possible shooting down of the airplane from another aircraft. Is that correct? PUTIN: There are two principal versions. The first version is that this plane was shot down by the Buk air defense system of the Ukrainian armed forces. And the second version is that the same system, the same system of arms—the Buk systems that are produced in Russia—was employed by the militia, the separatists. Primarily, let me say that in any case it’s a terrible catastrophe. And that is simply atrocious. And in this regard, let me say something. That would not have happened if the leadership of Ukraine had listened to us and had not started f',\n",
       "  'ull-fledged hostilities. It was the Ukrainian authorities who started to use all kinds of weapons systems in Donbass. Now as to the aircraft, the planes which were in the air—as far as I know, right away after this terrible catastrophe, one of the Ukrainian air controllers, I think he was a specialist originating from Spain, announced that he had seen a military aircraft in the corridor assigned for civil aircraft. And there could have been no other military aircraft than the one controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. Certainly that needs to be investigated. I’m not saying that this plane was shot down. I do not say that this military aircraft shot down the civil aircraft, but the question is what was that plane doing in the corridor because that is against the existing rules of the international flights of civil air aviation. As for the Buk air defense systems, which can send missiles from Earth—according to our specialists and experts, and not just our intelligence services but also our ballistic experts—the reports that I’ve received say that the strike hit the tail of the aircraft. And if that is the case, then that is exactly where the air defense system of the Ukrainian armed forces were stationed. So I don’t understand what they were doing there in the first place. Why were they there and why were they pulled out of there so quickly? In any case, that requires a thorough and de-politicized investigation. STONE: Do you believe the American intelligence has any information about this, because wouldn’t they be watching this situation after the coup? Wouldn’t they have intelligence from satellites and whatever? PUTIN: I’m confident that that is exactly the case. But regrettably, there is no proof from the partners that we’ve received. STONE: But they have not shown much? PUTIN: No, that’s quite understandable, because we understand their position on Ukraine. And certainly they all wanted to shift the blame on the militia fighters in Donbass and indirectly Russia, who supports the militia. STONE: So if they had contrary information they don’t want to release it? PUTIN: Yes, if this information is contrary then they will never',\n",
       "  ' reveal it. STONE: Can we talk about outside influences in this Ukraine story now? PUTIN: Yes, certainly. STONE: We know about the NGOs that were operating in Ukraine. We know that Victoria Nuland, the Undersecretary of State for Eastern Europe I believe, was very active supporting a change in government. We know that Senator John McCain visited and was seen at rallies with extremist leaders, including some neo-Nazis. We know that America and the National Endowment for Democracy, which is also a very influential private nonprofit NGO was very active, very active here. Paul Gershman, who was the president of it made very strong independent speeches—he wanted an independent Ukraine. And we know that the Hungarian billionaire hedge funder George Soros was also very involved in supporting the groups in Ukraine. PUTIN: Yes, all that is true. You know I do not always understand the rationale behind the actions of our partners. I already said that sometimes I fall under the impression that they’ve got to control or enforce some discipline in their Euro-Atlantic camp. And to that end they need some external enemy. And despite all the concerns they have, Iran at this point cannot fulfill this need. STONE: In other words, the United States can keep a united pro-American Europe and NATO with an external enemy such as Russia. PUTIN: I can say something definitely—that is true. I know that, I feel that. Without this internal discipline, the Euro-Atlantic cause is destabilized. This is not the Cold War we’re living in. Several years ago, certain leaders told me that our American friends were asking me to frighten them. But they said that they were not afraid. They understood that the world had changed. And that external threat—it is impossible to enforce this strict discipline. And in that regard, that is probably in the interests of someone, but I think that is the wrong logic. Because this logic is looking back into the past. But you have to look into the future. You have to understand that the world is different now. There are new threats arising, strategic threats included. You cannot freeze it as if we were still living through the Cold W',\n",
       "  'ar. I told you about the ABM system, about the ABM treaty, about the fight against terrorism. Regrettably, I have to say that all our attempts at fostering a relationship with the United States were met either with the lack of understanding or total indifference. But this situation cannot persist. STONE: I’m surprised. I’ve always had great respect for Russian intelligence services and their knowledge of the West, but in this situation I was surprised by their lack of, it seems, information of what was going on in Ukraine. It’s been said that you yourself were surprised by this takeover, and that you were paying attention to the Sochi Olympics and you weren’t paying attention to what was going on in Ukraine. What happened to your intelligence service? PUTIN: No, that is not true. I had a fairly good picture of what was happening within Ukrainian society. And there is no doubt about that. This take-over could have happened at any time. There was a takeover when Kuchma was leaving office. STONE: And a pro-Western group came in, is that what you’re saying? PUTIN: Yes, and Yanukovych was the one to win the elections. But the street did not agree with that outcome of the election, and a third round of elections was proclaimed in violation of the Constitution. So it was also a quasi-coup d’état. Back then I thought they had made a grave mistake. Even though pro-Western politicians arrived in power, people very soon lost their confidence in those leaders as well. Because those politicians continue to do everything that had been done before them by the previous leaders of the country. And that’s why they were defeated in the subsequent elections. Unfortunately, President Yanukovych didn’t manage to change much in the country either. And the same thing happened to him. The very paradigm has to be changed of their relation to the people. They were talking about the need to get rid of the oligarchs. And now the oligarchs are in power. So nothing has changed really. They were talking about the need to get rid of corruption. What has changed? Nothing. The governor of the Odessa region is now former President [of Georgia] Saakashvili. STONE: Y',\n",
       "  'eah, I know. PUTIN: That’s just a spit in the face, an insult to the people of Odessa and to the whole of the Ukrainian people. I do not want to give any assessments of Saakashvili, I think that would be the wrong thing to do. Whatever person he is, he was president of a nation [Georgia]. And it is up to the Georgian people to give him assessments. And besides, we are personally acquainted with him. He was not even granted a working visa in the United States. The investors he tried to get did not want to give him a permanent job. But quite strangely, he can act as the governor of the Odessa region [in Ukraine]. Are there no people with integrity, people from Ukraine who can do this job quite as well? It’s just ridiculous. And it’s an insult to the Ukrainian people. STONE: I have three specific questions about Ukraine, then perhaps we can take a walk? During the Maidan massacre, did you get any intelligence of what was going on? It’s the strangest massacre. Because of the number of casualties of policemen, and the civilians who were killed, and the policemen not firing back, they were retreating and called back by Yanukovych. And during that it seems like there was a sniper force that was definitely aiming at the policemen and civilians to create the chaos necessary for the takeover. PUTIN: To start with, that is absolutely correct. Yanukovych didn’t give an order to use weapons against civilians. And incidentally, our western partners, including the United States, asked us to influence him so that he did not give any orders to those weapons. And President Yanukovych said that he couldn’t imagine any other way of dealing with this situation. He couldn’t sign an order on the use of weapons. And when both the police and the protesters were shot at, it’s correct what you’ve said—the goal was to sow chaos. And certainly President Yanukovych was not interested in the expansion of this chaos. He was interested in containing the situation. But I have to say that the so-called protesters were very aggressive. STONE: Some of them, yes. PUTIN: Some of them centered in the office of the party of regents which was headed by President Yanukovy',\n",
       "  'ch. And they burned it down. And technical workers came out and they said we are not members of the party. There was one electrician. And he was shot and they were thrown into the basement and then everything was burned. And that was even before the takeover. So Yanukovych was not interested in chaos, he did everything he could in order to quiet the situation, to restore calm. STONE: Well, who are these snipers? PUTIN: Well, who could have placed these snipers? Interested parties, parties who wanted to escalate the situation. I do not have any data on who precisely those snipers were, but elementary logic tells me. STONE: Have you heard any reports about the training that was going on in other cities, in Minsk and so forth, of battalions and the Right Sector—hardened people of the right? There were 100-man units that came to the city, I am told, in the days before the Maidan massacre. PUTIN: No, not in Minsk, but we have information available to us that armed groups were trained in the western parts of Ukraine itself, in Poland, and in a number of other places. STONE: I see. Have you heard of the Azov battalion? PUTIN: Yes, certainly. There are certain armed formations which are not accountable to anyone, nor are they accountable to the central authorities in Kiev. I believe that is one of the reasons why the current leadership right now cannot put an end to these hostilities. That is simply because they are frightened that these uncontrollable armed forces will return to the capital. STONE: My second question—Mr. Obama, during this period, what kind of communications did you have with him? PUTIN: We were in constant contact. Well, I can say it was almost on a permanent basis. And Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov, they had personal meetings months ago and they also had telephone conversations. And myself and the president of the United States, we both had a great deal of regular telephone conversations. STONE: Obviously you didn’t agree. PUTIN: Yes, we had different assessments as to the causes of the Ukrainian crisis and its unfolding. STONE: Are you still talking to him? PUTIN: Yes, just a couple of days ago I had a telephone conversat',\n",
       "  'ion with him. We talked about our bilateral relations, the Middle East situation, and also the Ukrainian situation. But I have to tell you—I think that there is some understanding on a number of issues—despite the differences in our assessments. There is some common understanding. STONE: Would you say relations or the dialogue is cordial? PUTIN: No, but they are businesslike. And quite even. STONE: Do you see each other visually when you talk? PUTIN: No, but I can tell you that this dialogue is a dialogue of interested parties. So there is no confrontation behind it. I think that President Obama is a thinking person, he assesses the real situation, with some things he agrees, with others he disagrees. But we also manage to find points of common understanding on a number of complicated issues. And this is a fruitful dialogue. STONE: This is a just a trivial question, but I’ve always been curious, do you call each other Vladimir and Barack? PUTIN: Yes. STONE: You call him Barack or Barry? PUTIN: Barack. STONE: You do—first name, that’s great. Last question—Sebastopol and the meaning of it. It was your major submarine base, I believe, on the Black Sea. And it has obviously been a major defense facility. And you had an agreement with Crimea to have troops there—it was a base that was agreed to. I don’t know exactly when the treaty was made. How, when this was going down, obviously this is important in your mind—if the United States or NATO troops are able to take over this base, what are the consequences of that? PUTIN: I was thinking that this never was supposed to happen. Well, there is the subjunctive mood as we say, but there can be no subjunctive mood in politics—the “what if.” STONE: Hypothetical. PUTIN: And this treaty with Ukraine was supposed to be enforced until 2019. And after that it was supposed to be prolonged even further, I don’t remember—another 20 years probably. But in response to that we reduced the price of Russian natural gas for Ukraine. We gave them a large discount. And I’d like to draw attention to the fact that even though Crimea is right now part of the Russian Federation, this gas discount for Ukraine has',\n",
       "  ' not been withdrawn. STONE: Right. The consequences of a US seizure of the base or a NATO base? PUTIN: Those consequences would have been very grave, because, well this base per-se doesn’t mean anything—no significance, but if they had tried to station either ABM systems or offensive systems in those territories, that would no doubt have aggravated this situation in the whole of Europe. Incidentally, that is what is happening in Eastern European countries. I already talked about that. I just wanted to tell you about one nuance—why we are responding so acutely to the expansion of NATO? Well, as a matter of fact, we understand the value—or lack thereof—and the threat of this organization. I know this organization is a loose one and it’s not viable, even despite Article 5 of the treaty. What we’re concerned about is the practice of how decisions are made there. I know how decisions are made there. And the experience of previous years of work has given me full information as to how decisions are made. When a country becomes a member of NATO, bilateral talks are held on this country and it’s quite easy to deal with this country on a bilateral basis, including on the placement of weapons systems that are threatening to our security. Once a country becomes a member of NATO, it is hard to resist the pressure of such a large presence as the United States, and any weapons system can be stationed in this country all of a sudden. An ABM system, new military bases, and if need be, new offensive systems. And what are we supposed to do in that case? In this case we have to take countermeasures, and that means that we have to aim our missile systems at facilities which, in our view, are becoming a threat to us. And the situation becomes more tense. And who needs that, and why? STONE: You said that the base in Crimea didn’t mean anything in itself. Does that mean to say that you would have built another naval base on the Black Sea elsewhere? PUTIN: We already built such a military base. STONE: Oh, where’s that? PUTIN: In the city of Novorossiysk. And it’s more modern, more sophisticated than the last one. STONE: Interesting. What province or regi',\n",
       "  'on? PUTIN: It’s the Krasnodar region between Sochi and the Crimea. STONE: I see, good to know. PUTIN: So it’s also the Black Sea coast. Right. Thank you very much. * * * May 9, 2016 STONE: Quick updates on Syria and Ukraine—I’m talking about security on the borders of Russia. I was very impressed with the classical music symphony in Palmyra, but can you give me a quick update on Syria as it concerns Russian security and Ukraine? PUTIN: As far as Ukraine is concerned, I think you know what is going on. They have this crisis which, in a slackened form, is still going on. I think that the most important component of the Minsk Agreement is the political settlement, but regrettably it is up to the Kiev authorities to implement this part of the agreement, and so far they are not doing that. They should have amended the Constitution in accordance with the Minsk Agreement, and that should have been done before the end of 2015. But they didn’t do that. They were supposed to pass a bill, a law on amnesty. This law was adopted by the parliament, but it was not signed by the president, nor has it entered into force yet. There is another law that should be adopted and that should enter into force—that is the law on the special status of these unrecognized republics. The current Ukrainian leadership says the following: they say that since, at the line of conflict, there are still clashes, there is still violence, then they say the conditions are not yet in place to implement this political settlement. But in my view, this is only a hollow pretext because you can easily create a clash somewhere at the line of contact and then this is going to go on ad infinitum. The most important thing right now is to achieve a political settlement. Then there is a second course which explains why this is being done according to the Ukrainian counterparts. The Ukrainian leadership insisting that the Russian-Ukrainian border where the unrecognized republics are located, should be closed. And indeed the Minsk Agreements presuppose the closing of the Russian border by the Ukrainian frontier offices, but only after the key political decisions have been taken. But ',\n",
       "  'until these political decisions have been taken and implemented, until people are safe in those unrecognized republics, the closing of the border will only mean one thing—that they are going to be encircled and later eliminated. We talked about that during the long night when we hammered out the Minsk agreements. We talked about that in great detail. And our Ukrainian counterparts first agreed to that, but right now they seem as if they do not understand what is going on. Right now we support a proposal set forth by President Poroshenko to reinforce the observer contingent on the line of contact. He is the one who initiated this proposal and I have supported it. Moreover, he suggested that the OSC observers should be equipped with arms and we support that as well. The problem is further aggravated by the fact that the economic and internal political situation in Ukraine has deteriorated dramatically. And right now, some of our partners—I’m not going to name them—are saying that the Ukrainian president is not capable of making these political decisions due to the difficult internal political situation in Ukraine. And a year ago, I suggested that President Poroshenko should hold early elections and thereby reinforce his position, so that, even though we had differences, he would be able to push through all the required political decisions. But back then, our American friends, our European friends told us that the prime minister—back then it was Mr. Yatsenyuk and President Poroshenko had to pull their efforts together, they had to work together and we know how it ended—by a split up in the government and a very difficult political situation. And right now when I remind our partners of that, they simply shrug their shoulders. The question is, how does Russia fit into all this. And the United States and Europe keep coming up with new accusations, trying to accuse Russia of something new because they cannot publicly admit that they’ve made mistakes. That’s why they choose to blame Russia. We have quite a famous poet who wrote fables—his name was Krylov—and one of these fables features a dialogue between a wolf and a lamb. In this dialo',\n",
       "  'gue with the wolf, the lamb is trying to justify himself, saying that he is not to blame for anything. And once the wolf has run out of arguments, he decides to put an end to this discussion. And he says, “Dear lamb, you are only to blame because I am hungry.” [laughter] STONE: If this happens—you used the word “eliminated” I believe—what’s the worst-case? I mean, how many Russian-Ukrainians would be at risk? PUTIN: It’s not about the leadership of those unrecognized republics. You see, it’s that everyone who lives in those unrecognized republics—there are about three million citizens there—they participated in the election campaign, they took to the polls, and that’s why—in the absence of a law on amnesty—they can all be persecuted as separatists. STONE: Three million people at the great risk. So it could turn into another situation like in Serbia, Bosnia? PUTIN: Certainly, that’s what it looks like. We remember the tragedy of what took place in Odessa. More than 40 people—innocent, unarmed—were encircled and burned to death. And those who tried to get away were beaten to death with iron rods. And who was responsible? People adhering to extreme, radical views and such people can enter the territory of these republics and do the same thing there. When I talk about this issue with some of my Western partners, when I’m telling them that mass infringements of human rights can be transpiring there, do you know what they tell me? They tell me that these people have to go to human rights organizations to seek protection. They have to ask for help—different international organizations. Think of what took place at the trade union building in Odessa and ask yourself who is going to apply to an international organization after the massacre that took place there? STONE: I can’t imagine Russia standing by and watching that happen. PUTIN: Not in the least—certainly not. We are going to help, but we cannot do so unilaterally. Because the key decisions are to be taken by the Kiev authorities. * * * May 11, 2016 STONE: Okay, I’d like to skip forward from 2008 into the Ukraine crisis. We’ve had this discussion before on my first visit, on the ter',\n",
       "  'race, and I’ve listened to it and realized there are things I didn’t ask. And I want to go over it, just to be really clear, because this will be very important to the people who will be watching the documentary or reading this transcript. PUTIN: Certainly. Indeed, it requires a great deal of effort to clarify all that. Because your colleagues, your Western journalists are very talented people. They are capable of convincing people that black is white and vice versa. Just as an example—the tragic events, the assault against South Ossetia—Mr. Saakashvili publicly announced that he ordered his troops to commence that action. One of his dignitaries even spoke on television saying the same thing. I didn’t believe it when I heard it, when the media was accusing Russia of this attack. And millions of TV viewers believed that all across the world. This is just astounding, this capacity that your American and European journalists can have. You’re all very talented. But when our journalists try to protect Russian national interests, when they take a stance, they are declared immediately the mouthpiece of Kremlin propaganda—much to my chagrin. STONE: It’s a double standard. I would love to see a debate—a meeting between Mr. Saakashvili and you—it would be great to see the two of you in a room. PUTIN: We met on many occasions. STONE: Are you convinced he’s still mad? PUTIN: I have never said that. STONE: I thought you said he was mad? PUTIN: No, I was told by my Western counterparts that he was mad. And I could never afford to say anything like that to my counterpart, either the incumbent or the previous ones. STONE: When’s the last time you saw him? PUTIN: I do not remember. Certainly before the crisis in South Ossetia. STONE: Not after the war, though? PUTIN: No, but on many occasions I said to him, “Mikheil Nikolaevich, please do everything to prevent bloodshed. If you want to restore relations with these parts of Georgia, you have to be very cautious.” These fictions, these divergences, they had a reason a long time ago—not hundreds of years of ago—but back in 1919 when the Russian empire was splitting up. Those parts of Georgia, which ',\n",
       "  'incidentally had been part of the Russian Empire as independent states before Georgia became part of the Russian empire. Back then, those parts declared that they were ready, that they wanted to still be part of Russia. And back then very harsh actions, military measures were employed against them. Local populations still view those actions as genocide and mass elimination of people. In order to surmount all these difficulties, patience was required, as well as certain diplomatic art. STONE: Yeah, I understand. PUTIN: And that was lacking apparently. That’s what the Georgian leadership back then was lacking. Moreover, the current Georgian leadership believe that this action Saakashvili performed was a terrible crime against the Georgian people in the first place, because it has led to very grave consequences. STONE: I was shocked when Shevardnadze—hard name to pronounce—I was shocked because I really respected him as a foreign minister with Gorbachev. You may not agree, but I was shocked when he wanted to join NATO and he became corrupt, I heard. He was a very respected figure in the 1980s. PUTIN: Well, everything passes, everything changes. STONE: That’s true. But just quickly—Obama’s in office now, take it from 2008 to the Ukraine crisis and how this … nothing really major, dramatic happened, as I remember, except for the Snowden affair in 2013. He was offered asylum here in Russia and that upset America. But was there anything else in that period that you remember, between you and the US that was exacerbated, was argued about? PUTIN: Well, how can you say that nothing major happened? When President Kuchma’s term came to an end—I do not remember exactly the year—presidential elections took place in Ukraine. And Mr. Yanukovych won that presidential election, but the opposition didn’t like that. And mass riots erupted. These riots were fueled quiet actively by the United States. And a third round of elections was announced—in violation of the country’s constitution. Per se, this can be perceived as a coup d’état. And pro-Western politicians arrived in power after that—Mr. Yushchenko and Timoshenko. I cannot say that I welcomed th',\n",
       "  'is way of changing the government. Nowhere is that proper, but in the post-Soviet space, especially, constitutions cannot be broken. Luckily no bloodshed took place there. STONE: Did you have a phone call with Obama about this issue? PUTIN: That was before Obama came to office, and yet we maintained cooperation with the Ukrainian leadership of Mr. Yushchenko and Timoshenko. I went to Kiev, they came back to Moscow. We met in third party countries. And we implemented all our plans of cooperation, but their policy, it was not well-liked by the Ukrainian people. That is why after the presidential term of President Yushchenko ended, Mr. Yanukovych won the election once again and everyone acknowledged that. It was recognized by everyone. But apparently this was not the best form of government either. Economic difficulties, together with social difficulties, to a great extent had undermined the trust in the new leadership as well. What needed to be done in order to rectify the situation? They should have organized another election. And they should have chosen people with different economic and social views. These people should have made another attempt at arriving back in power. But certainly they should have prevented any escalation to bloodshed, and what’s absolutely certain is that no one should have supported these bloody events. STONE: But you’re talking about 2014—you’re jumping ahead. PUTIN: Yes, in 2014. STONE: But between ’08 and ’14, there was this one election you’re talking about which is in 2012, I think? PUTIN: I do not remember. STONE: There were so many, I mean, the Ukraine to us—we were not paying attention. VP; Yes, well you personally might not have been paying attention, but the CIA was paying a great deal of attention. STONE: I know. It was very confusing. There was a guy with a poisoned face earlier in the century. PUTIN: Yes, you’re talking about Yushchenko—he said that he’d been poisoned during the election campaign. And yet he was elected to office. And he worked and I met with him on many occasions. Why did they need to resort to violence? That’s something I cannot quite understand. Moreover, I talked about th',\n",
       "  'at repeatedly and the 2014 President Yanukovych was in office and he signed an agreement with the opposition. He agreed to all the requirements that they had set forth. STONE: In the crisis, in the final days? PUTIN: Yes and he even agreed to hold early elections. So why do they need to perform this coup d’état? I do not understand. STONE: Okay. So we all remember, I remember you vividly on television saying—I think it was with Charlie Rose, I forgot—but you said there was much evidence and you smiled as you said it. There was much evidence—implying that a thousand eyes were upon this. You know that expression, a thousand eyes were upon this coup. It was a coup in slow motion. It was pretty evident, transparent to the Russians. PUTIN: Certainly. STONE: And you said that on television, but I think the American people find it difficult to understand but, by talking about the evidence and showing it, we might be able to convince the American public that they were being fooled by the Western narrative of events and that there indeed was a coup d’état that went down. PUTIN: That’s very easy to achieve—you simply have to look at the developments. After Yanukovych announced that he had to postpone the signing of the association agreement with the European Union, no one listened to the reasons why, to the terms, to the timetables—mass riots erupted right away after the announcement. These riots led to the seizure of his residence, and on the eve of that, he had signed an agreement with the opposition on settling the situation, on the possible organization of early elections, and three foreign ministers of European countries added their signatures to the agreement. Where are these guarantees? Once the president went to the second largest city of the country to attended a political event, armed men seized the residence of the president. Imagine something like that in the US, if the White House was seized—what would it be called? A coup d’état, or would you say that they have come to sweep the floors. The prosecutor general was shot at. There were so many shootings, so much violence. STONE: I had an interview with Mr. Yanukovych, so I know ',\n",
       "  'his version, but it was characterized in the US press as if Yanukovych abandoned Kiev, because he felt the crowd would tear him apart. PUTIN: Yes, that’s the version used to justify the support granted to the coup d’état. Mr. Yanukovych didn’t leave to go abroad. He was in the country when his residence was taken. Moreover, one day afterwards, he used our support and he relocated to the Crimea. Back then, the Crimea was still part of Ukraine. And Yanukovych stayed there for more than 10 days—at least a week in the Crimea, thinking there was still a chance that those people who had put their signatures under the agreement with the opposition would make some attempt, with a view to settling this conflict by civilized, democratic, legal means. But it never happened. It became evident that if he was taken by these people he would simply be killed by them. And, afterwards, he found himself in Russia. Everything can be perverted or distorted, millions of people can be deceived if you have a monopoly on the media. But in the end, I believe for an objective and impartial spectator it’s clear what happened. A coup d’état had taken place. All right, if this coup d’état had made some positive changes … but, on the contrary, the situation deteriorated even further. Ukraine lost territory, not due to Russia’s actions, but due to the choice made by those who are live in Crimea. These people didn’t want to live under the banner of nationalists. A civil war erupted in the southeastern part of Ukraine, in the Donbass. After that, the country witnessed a terrible drop in the GDP. The largest industrial enterprises shut down. Unemployment soared. The real income of the population, their salaries, plunged, inflation hit 45 or 47 percent. And no one knew how to address these issues, or that this would be further exacerbated by an internal political crisis, by a fight between the Prime Minister and the President. In the end, it led to Prime Minister Yatsenyuk resigning. He had actively supported, and had been supported by, the American administration throughout the crises. And what happened next? The European Union opened its borders to Ukraine. It ze',\n",
       "  'roed out the tariff for Ukrainian goods. But Ukraine’s trade with the European Union decreased by 23 percent, and with Russia it decreased by 50 percent. Ukrainian industrial output is not in high demand in European markets and now they have no access to the Russian market. The agricultural produce that used to be traded successfully in Western Europe is restricted by quotas. And these quotas were introduced by the Europeans. They were exhausted during the first two months after the signing of the agreement. Right now Ukraine is fighting to get a visa-free arrangement for its citizens. Do you know why they are doing that? So they could ensure free exit from the country to find new jobs outside of the country. But the people are once again being tricked, because even if a visa-free deal were granted to Ukraine, that would not enable them to work abroad. STONE: Visa-free to Russia? PUTIN: No, visa-free to the European Union. People heard that they would be able to relocate and work in another country in Europe. There’s something I’d like to tell you. Ukraine has always been an industrialized country as part of the Soviet Union. And right now, a Ukrainian’s dream is to work as a nurse or a gardener or a nanny in a European country amid the complete de-industrialization of the country. Why did they need all that? I simply cannot imagine. STONE: Well, it seems to me what you’re saying is that Russia doesn’t need Ukraine. PUTIN: Russia is a self-sufficient country. We do not need anyone, but with Ukraine we are connected by thousands of ties. On many occasions I’ve said that and I’d like to reiterate. I’m deeply convinced that the Ukrainian people and the Russian people are not simply close relatives. They are almost the same. As for the language, the culture, the history, each certainly has to be treated with respect. And even when we were one single country, we treated them with respect. Suffice it to say that the whole of the Soviet Union for decades, was managed by those who originated from Ukraine. I think that testifies to a lot. STONE: Yes, but economically, as you say, you’re self-sufficient. They’re gone—let them have their pr',\n",
       "  'oblems. It’s not going to destroy your country. PUTIN: No, certainly—not in the least. STONE: One point you made in our last meeting. I asked, “What about the Russian submarine base in Crimea?” Sebastopol I think it was. And you said it was not important because you have another base across the water—somewhere around here. In other words, you weren’t threatened by the loss of the base. That’s what you told me at the time. PUTIN: Losing the base in Sebastopol was a threat, but it was not too sensitive. Because by that time … right now we are commissioning a new military base—indeed not far from here in Novorossiysk. What was presenting certain difficulties to us was the severing of ties between the companies of the defense sector. Because the defense sectors of Ukraine and Russia during the Soviet period were one single system. And if these relations were severed, then that certainly would lead to a certain negative impact on our defense industry. But we have devised a whole system for input-substitution as we call it. And right now, we are actively surmounting all of these difficulties. We are establishing new enterprises from scratch, and these enterprises produce a new generation of military equipment. And that defense industry in Ukraine which used to provide support to Russia is now simply dying out—I’m talking about the missile industry, aircraft industry and also engine construction. STONE: I understand. In other words, the US succeeded in starting the coup, and winning as they did many times over the years. And it was a loss, but not a fatal loss. PUTIN: You could say that. Moreover, when I say that we started establishing new enterprises that help propel us to new technological levels, I often cite this example. All of our helicopters used to be equipped with engines produced in Ukraine—100% of our helicopters. Once the supplies from Ukraine stopped, we built a new plant, right now we are completing another one. All helicopters can fly—fully functional—and we have engines of a new generation. So as you can see, what our air force is doing in Syria testifies to the fact that we are doing quite well. STONE: Even if NATO ent',\n",
       "  'ered into an agreement with Ukraine, I still don’t see too much of a threat, with the new weaponry. PUTIN: I see a threat. This threat consists of the fact that once NATO comes to this or that country, then as a whole the political leadership of that country, as well as the population there, cannot influence the decisions NATO makes—including the decisions related to stationing the military infrastructure. Even very sensitive weapons systems can be deployed. I’m talking also about the antiballistic missile systems. And that means that we would have to respond somehow to that. STONE: Plus all the weapons we’ve put into the Baltic States? PUTIN: I’m talking about this strategic anti-ballistic missile system (ABMs). There are only two facilities like that in Eastern Europe—in Romania and in Poland. And at sea in the Mediterranean, there are plans to deploy these systems on ships. Right now negotiations are under way to do the same in South Korea. All that certainly creates a threat to our nuclear deterrence system. Let me remind you that I myself proposed to our American partners that we should work on these systems together. What would that imply? That would imply that we would designate the missile threats together, and we would create a joint system for ABM management. Then we would exchange technological information. And all of that in my view would spell cardinal drastic changes in the world as far as national security is concerned. I’m not going into details right now. But our proposal was declined by our American counterparts, [as I’ve said many times]. STONE: Of course. Okay. But it seems to me that Russia adapts and you are adapting to these ABMs. Am I wrong? PUTIN: We have these capabilities, we are improving them, and when we talked with our American counterparts, we told them that we deemed the construction of those systems as a threat, and they always responded that this was not against us. This was against the missile aspirations of Iran. As of now an agreement has been reached, fortunately, with Iran. But the deployment of this system still goes forward. What does it tell us? We were right. But back then when we were ',\n",
       "  'discussing that, we were saying we would have to take actions in response, and these actions were to partly consist in improving our offensive capabilities. Their response was as follows. The ABM system they told us was not established against us. And what we were going to do—that is, to improve our own offensive capability—would be considered by the United States as not aimed against the United States. And we agreed on that. STONE: You know, the American Indians made treaties with the US government and they were the first to experience the treachery of the US government. You’re not the first. PUTIN: We wouldn’t like to be the last. [laughter] STONE: In that regard, I’d like to show you a piece of film from Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” set in the war rooms of the United States. One scene we can see and then if you like we can see another one. But first, to just finish this Ukraine thing. My ultimate question is, in hindsight, looking back, did you make a mistake by annexing Crimea because it cost you tremendously—the sanctions, the whole EU turns on Russia, the US—it becomes big news because it’s regarded as illegal in the international post-war treaty world. Not to say that other people haven’t broken their treaties, but … Anyway, it did cost you big time and you perhaps miscalculated. Perhaps you thought it would be acceptable in some way. Have you ever thought about that decision in retrospect? PUTIN: We did not force Crimea into Russia. Those who live in Crimea have decided to join Russia. And when following this path we were very cautious, and in full compliance with international law and the United Nations charter. The first thing that was done in Crimea itself was not by us, but by those who inhabit Crimea. The legitimate parliament of Crimea that was elected based on the Ukrainian legislation, announced a referendum. The Crimean parliament, by an overwhelming vote, decided, after the referendum, to join Russia. I know of no other way that would be more democratic to address issues of this kind than the free will of the people. The expression of this free will, was that an overwhelming majority had voted for indepen',\n",
       "  'dence and for joining Russia. On the whole, during the referendum, it was 90 percent or even more. If there is a better or more democratic way to address this issue, please tell me about that. Today, I hear only the opinion that contains the attempt at justifying that our actions, with regard to Crimea, were not correct. That is, the central authorities of Ukraine did not agree to that. That’s what they argue. But let me remind you that when a decision on Kosovo’s independence was taken, the United Nations International Court of Justice decided that on issues related to independence and self-determination, no consent from the central authorities of this or that country were required. And please say for those who will see this film [or read this transcript], that the letter from the State Department of the United States addressed to the UN Security Council on this matter says the State Department supports Kosovo’s decision on independence wholeheartedly. Other European countries spoke in the same vein. And in this regard I do not quite understand why the Kosovars would have these rights, whereas Russians, Ukrainians, and Crimean Tatars who live in Crimea in a similar situation would not enjoy the same rights. I think that is absolutely unacceptable. That is what we call having double standards. And we do not regret anything. This is not just about the future of Soviet territories. We’re talking about the future of millions of people, and we didn’t have a choice, really. Only one decision was possible—to agree with this request from the Crimeans about the reunification with Russia. Just one more thing—our troops were there. But these troops didn’t take a single shot. The only thing they did was to create conditions for these elections to take place and for the referendum to take place. And I reiterate, even though I said that on many occasions, in the course of these events there was not a single victim. STONE: Let me put it this way—did you expect to be excommunicated by the European community because of this? PUTIN: Certainly I did expect this kind of reaction. But before making this decision, we had conducted a very deep social ',\n",
       "  'research in Russia, and the overwhelming majority of Russian citizens—around 80 percent or more—when responding to the question whether it was possible to re-unify Crimea with Russia, even though that would mean a deterioration of relations with the West and other countries of the world, they said yes they thought it was possible. So when making this decision, I was guided not by the preferences of my counterparts from other countries. I responded to the sentiment of the Russian people. STONE: And the Crimeans as of this date, are they grateful? Or are they pissed off? VP; There are many problems in Crimea, but on the whole, people support the decision which was taken. The best estimate of that support was the poll that was recently conducted in Crimea because the Kiev authorities tried to set up an energy blockade of the peninsula. The overwhelming majority—I’m talking about the same figures—the overwhelming majority re-affirmed the decision they had made earlier on joining Russia. STONE: And Donbass? Well, this is a real problem, I guess, in terms of the thorn that doesn’t go away. How do you get out of this one? PUTIN: Certainly, I think the Minsk Agreement has to be implemented. STONE: But it doesn’t seem like Kiev has any intention of doing so. PUTIN: I do have all the plans, and the Russian leadership as a whole, we have these plans. But the key components of the Minsk agreements are the political components, and the main political component is to make amendments to the Ukrainian constitution. It should have been done, not by us, but by the Kiev authorities, by the end of 2015. And a law on amnesty has to be adopted and it has to have force. It has been adopted, but it has not been promulgated by the president. A special status law in these territories has to be enforced. This law has also been adopted. It has been voted on by the Ukrainian parliament but it has not been enforced. We cannot do that for them. But I’m hopeful that in the end this is going to be done. And the conflict is going to end.

Now that he likes to travel, would Bergman venture into Lotusland? He is ambivalent. “I very much admire the American way of filmmaking. It’s very vital, and extremely stimulating.

       " ['Alfred Hitchcock and Saboteur It was 1941, and Alfred Hitchcock had a picture about to be released called Suspicion, with Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. He came to New York for the premiere of the picture at Radio City Music Hall, which was the most desirable place to open. He had been brought to America and put under contract by David O. Selznick, and was preparing a picture called Saboteur, with a script by Dorothy Parker, Alan Campbell, Joan Harrison and Peter Viertel. Hitchcock was looking for someone to play the title role of the saboteur; he wanted an unknown because of the nature of the story. He mentioned this to John Houseman, who was also working for Selznick, and Houseman suggested to him that I might be right for the part. Houseman also got in touch with me, telling me to call Hitchcock at the St. Regis, which I did, using Houseman’s name to get through to Hitch. He was very kind and polite and suggested I come to see him. I did so, and it was the st',\n",

Hitchcock had made only two pictures in America — Suspicion and Rebecca — after his English work, but it impressed me, as I came into his presence, that he was the definition, in one’s imagina\\xadtion, of an international motion picture director. I don’t mean in the cliché Hollywood style, or as in a George S. Kaufman comedy, but in the sense of a director one felt to be a major figure in the contemporary entertainment world. It was more than that; it was an international aura of St. Moritz, trains, the best food, cigars, rare wines — all the fantasies that you saw on the screen, he seemed to em\\xadbody in the way he lived. Actually, only part of that was true. He had a great sense of that world but he lived very quietly, like a bourgeois. He projected a professionalism, a big-league quality, immediately, and he was very much at ease. He was then in his early forties. He told me what he had in mind and sa',\n",

I was to select a scene with a character who was like the character in the film, which he described to me. We had a chat about Houseman and Hitch’s new picture, Suspicion, and the fact that I had also seen his English work. I had seen the first of his films to be released in America, including The Man Who Knew Too Much, during the run of Noah, because Pierre Fresnay was in it. Then came The Thirty-Nine Steps, and The Girl Was Young. He was considered an arty director then; these were released as art films. I selected a scene from Blind Alley, a successful play of which variations have since been made — Desperate Hours and Detective Story: people held hostage by the criminal. I played the criminal in a short scene — less than two minutes. It was a single shot, with cues thrown to me from off-stage. There were also other actors testing. The film was sent off to Hitc',\n",

I was given round-trip transpor\\xadtation by plane. That was my first trip to California by air, which in those days was a journey of about twenty- one hours. You slept in a berth on the plane. There were several stops. Hitch never referred to the test again although he had hired me on the basis of it. The producer, Jack Skirball, did. He was then a theatre exhibitor, financier and in partnership with Bruce Manning. Together, they were producing the film independently at old Universal. Hitchcock was on loan-out from Selznick. Jack Skirball was very kind and hospitable. One day he took me out to dinner and told me, “You know that test? I th',\n",
       "  'ought you overdid it.” He was probably right. Theatre acting was then a lot more florid than it is today, and it could well have been that I did a lot of “acting” to make the character of the psychopathic killer convince Hitchcock that I could be a deranged saboteur. In fact, that part was written quite differently. Saboteur starred Robert Cummings, Priscilla Lane and some very good character actors like Otto Kruger, Egon Brecher, Alma Kruger, Alan Baxter and Ian Wolfe. Hitch was shooting when I arrived. I came on the set and he greeted me most charmingly. I waited. The shooting day was almost over and he invited me for a drink. This was my first experience drinking with Hitchcock; from then on, I was on my guard. We went across the street from the lovely old Univer\\xadsal lot to a bar and restaurant run by one of the prop men, Eddie Keyes. Hitch ordered a martini, and I said I would have the same. When Hitch’s “usual” arrived, it was in a goblet the size of those',\n",

At no time in my life have I been much of a drinker; I was also not accustomed to driving, having learned when I was in Hollywood in 1939 with Orson, and not having driven in New York since. The drink made me fear for my safety; on the other hand, I was afraid that if I didn’t drink it, I might lose the part. I just sipped while Hitch drank one, then another. He never got drunk; it was his normal appetite. Before I came to Hollywood, I had done some second unit work on the picture in New York. Once I was cast in the part, Hitch sent John Fulton to New York to direct the unit. He was the foremost trick cameraman in Hol\\xadlywood; if you needed effects shot, he was the best man in town and, in his own way, a star. The Statue of Liberty sequence has become one of the most famous Hitchcock ever made, and in the years since Saboteur I have often',\n",
       "  ' been asked how it was done. Audiences seem to know more about technical matters these days, perhaps because of the proliferation of all kinds of cameras. But at that time, audiences couldn’t understand how the sequence was shot. That was precisely the effect that Hitchcock desired because as a director, as a man of great visual power, he looked for a style that would not only give the audience the emotional kick that he hoped for but would also leave them puz\\xadzled. I will get to the specifics of that as I lay out the se\\xadquence, which is probably my claim to fame, for people always say, “Oh yes — you fell off the Statue of Liberty.” In the story of Saboteur, my character commits the crime at the beginning of the film and the entire picture is a chase. Bob Cummings, the hero, tries to find and cap\\xadture me. Two or three reels from the end, he finds me just as I’m about to blow up a boat — a Liberty ship carrying goods for the war. At one point I run into Radio Ci',\n",

They are shoot\\xading from the audience; I’m shooting from the stage. At the same time, a gun-fight is in progress on the screen, so it is never clear where the sound of revolvers is coming from; you’re not sure if it’s from the screen, my revolver, or Cummings’s. A man in the audience falls over dead, clearly shot by me from the stage, with only the woman next to him aware of it. The essence of the Hitchcock touch in that sequence was not only the intermingling of reality, so to speak, with film, but also the humor of the situation, in which the audience continued to think all the shots being fired were on the screen; they were laughing. They were never aware of the real gun battle. From there — in the continuity of the story, not in the order in which the film was shot (the Radio City Music Hall s',\n",

While we were shooting in California, news reached us that the Normandie was burning. This French ship was at that time the largest in the world; it was being prepared for the troops to use when it was sabotaged. In flames, the ship had keeled over. Hitch asked Universal Newsreel division, which existed at that time, to get some footage of the boat burn\\xading. He also had them shoot plates of a car going down the West Side Highway — an elevated structure which bordered the west side of Manhattan along the docks. He put me in a mock-up of a taxi and said, “When I cue you, look to your right as if you see the Normandie.” He wanted a look that would be used as a cut — the jux\\xadtaposition of going down the highway, then a turn of the head with a slight smile, and the cut of the boat burning; it all tied together, indicating I had somethin',\n",
       "  'g to do with the burning boat. It is remembered as a chilling moment. From a directorial point of view, it shows a man who was really on his toes and aware of any opportunity to create something for his film: to take history at the mo\\xadment and incorporate it into a script — in character, story and action. Hitch always claimed the contrary: “I lay out the script shot for shot. It’s boring to shoot a picture be\\xadcause I’ve done it all in the script.” But that was an ex\\xadample of his not having done this. It was history and ab\\xadsolutely memorable. The cab arrived at the Battery at the tip of Manhattan. In those days an aquarium was there, and the docks from which boats left for the Statue of Liberty, on Bedloe’s Is\\xadland. When we shot there with John Fulton’s second unit, it was December 15th, 1941, a few days after Pearl Harbor, but it was supposed to be spring. It was very cold, but I could not wear my hat and coat for the scene. I went into the warmth of the little',\n",

Coffee and doughnuts were being served while the first shots of my arriving at the ticket office, then ascend\\xading the gangplank of the boat, were being prepared. John Fulton was also going to shoot plates to be used on Stage 12 at Universal when we went to California. We had a big problem that day with clouds; it was overcast, so John did not have the light that he wanted much of the time. We did a lot of waiting; we would do two or three takes and wait again. After the scene at the gangplank, which we did two or three times, we did the scene on the boat, going across the water. I went out on deck to the railing at the front of the boat to look at Pris\\xadcilla Lane, whom I was trying to pick up, at the opposite railing. Fulton also had to shoot plates for Priscilla Lane, who wasn’t there, as well as my plates and shots of me looking into the bay. The extras were in ',\n",
       "  'these scenes, which we shot several times. Next, we landed on Bedloe’s Island where we shot coming off the boat four times, again waiting for the right light. From there, we did a shot walking from the land\\xading up to the base of the Statue of Liberty, also requiring several takes. It was then time to eat, and box lunches ar\\xadrived. One little old lady who was obediently repeating all these actions with the extras finally turned to one of them and said, “Do you have to do this every time you want to see the Statue of Liberty?” She had come from Virginia and had decided to see the statue the first thing in the morning» Wandering into the nice group of people who were having coffee and doughnuts, she had thought, “My goodness, what are all of these terrible stories I hear about New York? They’ve made me feel welcome with coffee and doughnuts, although they have this curious way of making you repeat all these things to see the statue.” It was explained to her that s',\n",

This was needed for anyone who was going to be seen on film — which she was. Finally, we did the scene going into the base of the Statue of Liberty. This was it for the day; Fulton had his plates and live-action of me. John then went to the top of the statue, to shoot plates from there to the base, the bay, the harbor and so on. This done, I went to California to perform in the picture. Saboteur is remembered chiefly for the Statue of Liber\\xadty sequence.

At the end of the scene, she speaks my name and I realize that I have been trapped. I look out and see speedboats arriving, which would not normally happen at Bedloe’s Island. I move out of the inside of the crown and onto its balcony. I did not do this on the real Statue of Liberty, of course. Hitchcock had the hand, torch and balcony built to scale on stage twelve of Universal. It was enormous. Parallels had been built out to the balcony with mattres\\xadses. The inside of the crown was also built to scale, as all the dialogue scenes were done by Hitch at Universal. Bob Cummings came out onto the balcony, following me. As we moved around, he pulled a gun and made a gesture towards me with it, I panicked and went over the balcony railing onto the parallel covered with mattres\\xadses, where I was caught by a ',\n",
       "  'grip named Scotty who was stationed to make sure I wouldn’t go off the parapet. At this point, Hitch switched to doubles. For the long shot, Davey Sharp, one of the greatest of stuntmen, repeated my fall backwards over the railing, through the air. He then caught the crotch of the thumb and forefinger on the statue and held on with both hands. Bob Cummings’s stunt double, also in long shot, climbed down the forefinger to try to rescue me; Fry, the character I played, had to be taken alive to be persuaded to talk. When Hitch returned to close-ups, he disassembled the torch piece. He put the thumb and forefinger piece of the torch, and the crotch of the thumb and the forefinger, down on the floor of the stage. The camera was angled at me lying on my stomach on the set piece, and 1 did all the close-up reactions there. Bob Cummings came down the forefinger, but could only reach the sleeve of my jacket. There were then intercuts between my close-up, Bob Cummings’s ',\n",
       "  'close-up and the seam where the sleeve was stitched to the jacket, which began to tear. Bob tried to get my hand to prevent me from falling, pulling the sleeve to bring me closer to him. But my hand was clinging to the statue, and he couldn’t get a grip on me. Eventually the sleeve came off and I fell, from a big close-up. I fell without a cut to the base of the statue, one continuous scream all the way down. That is what Hitch was building up to; that is the problem he had set for himself. The fall had to be done without a cut from a close-up. People have wondered how we did that to this day. When Ben Hecht saw the sequence — referring to the sleeve that parted from my jacket — he told Hitchcock he thought I should have had a better tailor. Hitch himself decided that the only problem with the sequence, which is technically supreme, was that the story had the wrong man in jeopardy. It should have been the hero, he thought. He concluded that the scene on the han',\n",
       "  'd of the statue, with all the technical and cinematic wizardry to hype up the audience, would have been more affecting had Bob Cummings been in jeopardy. John Fulton designed the falling scene in consultation with Hitch. Hitch knew a great deal about art direction; he had worked as an art director in silent films in London when he was young. He also knew more about trick photog\\xadraphy than most people, so he could talk to Johnny Fulton as a peer. This is how they did it. The removable piece of the statue — the thumb and forefinger — was taken to another stage and attached to a platform six feet high. The platform was on counterweights and rigged to the top of the stage. A hole was cut in the platform, with a camera placed to shoot down through the hole, towards the set piece fixed below it. Underneath the whole thing was a saddle-like affair on which I sat, on a pipe about four-and-a-half feet high, based on a black cloth. On a cue, the camera, on the counterwei',\n",
       "  'ght system, starting from a close-up of me, would go up in the air to the grid, together with the set piece of the thumb and forefinger, leaving me behind; thus giving the effect of falling. This was shot at different speeds, while I did move\\xadments of falling rather slowly and balletically. By the time the camera got to the top of its move, it had gone from an extreme close-up to a very long shot of my ap\\xadparently falling figure. The small saddle was not visible; the pipe and black cloth, which were seen, were later painted out in a traveling matte shot. Hitch succeeded in achieving what he wanted, which was to do the fall in one cut. I was so fortunate to make my first picture with Hitchcock. I started at the top, and was introduced to a way of picture-making, a way of conducting oneself on the set—a way of life regarding a picture—that of an in\\xadternational star director. Not only was he an artist, but there was a very special world which he projected. Hitch a',\n",

It was characteristic of his mind — so well organized. He would walk on the set and conduct it as if it were a fine banking firm in England — very quiet and masterful. But he had great humor and a sense of fun. He still had remnants of his gift for practical jokes at that time, and sometimes played them; they were always very funny. He left an indelible mark on me of what it means to be a director and how to conduct oneself on the set. Chaplin and Renoir, with whom I worked later, each had a unique genius.

LLOYD: Jack Skirball had bought the property. He had done a few pictures previously, and went on to do Shadow of a Doubt with Hitchcock later. Hitch actually developed Saboteur.

Early on he asked Hitch if he would like to look at a shot through the camera. Hitch told him no, thank you; he had looked through a camera before. He never looked through the camera. He knew exactly the image that he wanted; he would ask the cameraman what lens he was using and where he was cutting the actor, at the knees or at the chest, etc. Upon receiving this information, he was ready to shoot. His chair was put alongside the camera. I began to learn about the camera from Hitch — then, and also later, when we worked together on the television series. It was a source of pride that major directors sel\\xaddom moved the camera, and would only move it if there was a real motivation for doing so, in the case of an actor moving — from a sofa to a chair across the room.

All that changed with! the introduction of zoom lenses and other sophisticated equipment, such as the crab dolly and its variations. Hitchcock sparked the invention of the crab dolly be\\xadcause of his demand for it; he wanted a camera that could not only dolly but could also move the way a crab moved — backward, forward, sideways and all the ways in be\\xadtween. With the sophisticated technical improvements, and particularly with the expansion of television and its new techniques, many directors arrived from film schools, where they had become proficient with the equipment. They had become so enamored of the zoom that it became a thing in itself after a while. It can dilute staging and staging skill and result in the actor being ignored. It reached its zenith with the directors of commercials, who are full of tricks because ',\n",
       "  'they have to be; they have thirty seconds to catch the eye of the audience with zooms, tricks, dissolves, fast pans and curious dollies. All this moved into story-telling from commercials, which it must be admitted, did produce some good directors, particular\\xadly in England; they come into pictures with a strong visual sense, but for the most part, the effect becomes an end in itself. In the final analysis, one must remember the director is the storyteller. He may not be the creator of it, but he is telling it, and it is his gifts as a storyteller that hold the audience. I remember Bertolt Brecht telling me, “Even a poem must have a story.” What distinguishes people in this business, one from another, is the story he or she has to tell. An actor walking on stage, whether it be theatre or film, should carry a story with him — a personal story. To the extent to which that story is attractive or unique is the extent to which an audience will be interested in him. J',\n",

He used very little film; there are tales of his coming back after completing a day’s work and not having used up one reel of film. He’d got everything he’d wanted. Hitch would shoot a scene and say, “Cut — that’s all you need.” It was a phrase of his, when he had all he wanted; he was seeing it as a piece of the story. Renoir said, later, that the most important ele\\xadment is the actor and what he is doing. What is impor\\xadtant is what is happening in front of the camera and not behind it.

While play\\xading tennis at the homes of people in the business, I thought, “What a marvelous way to live, with tennis courts and swimming pools.” Back at 123rd Street around Morningside Drive it was dreary. I returned and did a few undistinguished plays, among them a musical for the CIO called Marching with Johnny. It was directed by Phil Loeb. Zero Mostel was around, because he was a friend of both Phil’s and mine. I didn’t want to do many of the comedy sketches; I at\\xadtempted to get Zero to do them. While we were trying it out in Newark, he kept saying, “',\n",
       "  'This stuff is so funny, Norman, you’re all wrong about it.” Phil Loeb said the same thing. Finally, I quit. I said to Zero, “If it’s so funny, you do it.” Zero said, “Oh, no. It’s no good.” Phil finally went into the show himself, because he couldn’t find anyone else to do if; they went on to Philadelphia, where they closed. It was typical of the shows I did in 1942 and 1943. Then in 1944 I got an offer from John Houseman, who was producing at Paramount Pictures, to come to Hol\\xadlywood to do a film called The Unseen, with Joel McCrea, Gail Russell and Herbert Marshall. It was a sequel to a successful ghost picture called The Uninvited with Ray Milland; Lewis Allen directed both of them. I had come out alone, while Peggy and Susanna stayed in New York When shooting was over, I decided to see if I could get work in Hollywood as an actor. A few weeks later, Hitchcock offered me a part, in Spellbound. It was a scene early in the film, with Ingrid Bergman; it establi',\n",

It was an honor to do it for him; I enjoyed it, and I played in the first scene that Hitchcock ever directed with Ingrid. Ingrid was a woman of great strength and charm. I worked with her later, over a longer period of time, on Arch of Triumph as Lewis Milestone’s associate. At the time of Spellbound, she was still rising to the top of her profession. She was a very well-known actress and was about to become the top star in the business. She was under contract to Selznick, as was Hitchcock; Selznick was making Spellbound. Hitch laid out this first scene in a certain way, though Ingrid had other ideas — something to do with the move\\xadment, I think; it was not to do with character or inter\\xadpretation. But Flitch had a definite concept of the shot and I assume that what Ingrid wanted would have altered i',\n",
       "  't. Hitch, having made up his mind, would not alter any\\xadthing — that was not his way. He had a great sense of himself and he was a vain man; he wasn’t going to change a shot because an actor or actress had something else in mind. It was certainly true then, and perhaps to a certain ex\\xadtent it still is, that the director had to give off an air of in\\xadfallibility. Today, there is a little more give and take, though we still have directors who are God figures. Then, directors ruled by fear, by command, by their posi\\xadtion. With John Ford, you took your life in your hands if you suggested anything. Betty Field once told me that when she did Cheyenne Autumn with Ford, she made a suggestion about what kind of dress she would wear. It was just an ordinary house dress.

He is without question one of the world’s most successful, and brilliant, composers for film, although he continues to write surprising music for the concert hall as well. The prolific. Italian-born composer first came to worldwide prominence\\xa0as a result of his collaboration with director Sergio Leone on a trilogy of Clint Eastwood movies: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). His unique approach to those now-classic Westerns—including offbeat vocal effects and orchestrations that ranged from the traditionally\\xa0symphonic to the bizarre—launched a career that has few, if any, parallels in the history of movie music. Born in Rome in 1928, Morricone studied composition with Goffre\\xaddo Petrassi at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia. He worked as an arranger from the late Fifties through the mid Sixties, with such performers\\xa0as Mario Lanza, Paul Anka, Charles Aznavour, an',\n",

In addition to Leone, Morricone began to work with some of the greatest directors of European cinema, among them Pier Paolo Pasolini (Uccellacci e Uccellini, 1965, and Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom, 1975); Mauro Bolognini (L’Assoluto Naturale, 1969, and Metello, 1970); Elio Petri (Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion, 1969); Gillo Pontecorvo (The Battle of Algiers, 1965, and Burn!, 1969); Henri Verneuil (The Sicilian Clan, 1969, and The Burglars, 1971); Giuliano Montaldo (Sacco and Vanzetti, 1971); and Bernardo Bertolucci (1900, 1976). Morricone remained the composer of choice for Sergio Leone. His scores for the director’s Once Upon a Time in the West (1969), Duck, You Sucker (1971) and Once Upon a Time in America (1984) and, with Leone as producer, My Name Is Nobody (1973), were remarkable\\xa0for their inventiveness and color. He wrote more than just Westerns, however. Morricone found ',\n",
       "  'scripts for police action films, psychological dramas, comedies, historical epics, and romances piling up at his door. Among the American and British directors who engaged him with high-profile projects were Don Siegel (Two Mules for Sister Sara, 1970), John Boorman (Exorcist II: The Heretic, 1977), Terence Malick (Days of Heaven, 1978), Richard Fleischer (Red Sonja, 1985) and William Friedkin (Rampage, 1987). Still, despite the huge international recording success of his The Good, the Bad and the Ugly theme, the composer was not widely-known in the United States except to film buffs and an ever-growing audience of soundtrack-album collectors. That long-overdue recognition came with Morricone’s universally admired, orchestral-and-choral score for the Roland Joffe epic The Mission (1986). It brought him one of his four Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score. He had previously been nominated for Malick’s Days of Heaven; later nominations were accorded him for Brian DePalma’s The Untouch\\xadables (1987) and Barry Levinson’s Bugsy (1991).',\n",
       "  ' Other major Morricone scores since The Mission have included Roman Polanski’s Frantic (1988), DePalma’s Casualties of War (1989), Franco Zeffirelli’s Hamlet (1990), Pedro Almodovar’s Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990), Joffe’s City of Joy (1992), Wolfgang Petersen’s In the Line of Fire (1993) and Mike Nichols’s Wolf (1994). A particular favorite among moviegoers worldwide is Giuseppe Tornatore’s Cinema Paradiso (1988), winner of the Best Foreign Film Oscar. In addition to his estimated four hundred motion picture scores, Morricone has composed equally memorable music for such acclaimed TV miniseries as Moses the lawgiver (1975) and Marco Polo (1982) and a number of television films including Secret of the Sahara (1987). Bryan Forbes’s The Endless Game (1989) and four of the La Piovra films for European television (1985-1990). His “Chi mai,” the theme from Jerzy Kawalerowicz’s Maddalena (1971), became an international\\xa0hit after its use in the BBC series The Life and Times of David Uoyd George (1981).

Despite his fame in the film world, however, Morricone has also continued to write and perform music for the concert hall. His more than fifty compositions for the classical field include works for chamber groups, symphony orchestra, solo voice, and choral ensembles. Virgin Records has recorded several of his chamber pieces; he also is one of the prime movers behind the improvisation group Nuova Consonanza.

Simultaneous translation was provided, respectively, by Lena Erin and Vivian Treves. —Jon Burlingame * * * Cineaste: Critics in this country don’t take film music seriously. Do you consider film music as valid a form as chamber music, symphonic writing, or opera? Ennio Morricone: Film music is not at the same level as classical or chamber music because those compositions are born naturally from the composer himself. The composition expresses itself without any conditions or limitations. In the cinema, the music is conditioned by the images and by the direction of the director, and therefore is complementary to the film. This does not mean that film music is not worthwhile. It always depends on who’s writing it. It’s not seriously considered because there is a grave infiltration, throughout the entire world, including America, of amateurs and dilettantes, people who do not know music. Therefore, this lowers the level of the profession, and film music is not considered a serious art form. Cineaste: What ',\n",
       "  'control, if any. do you have over the use of your music in a film once you’ve delivered it to the producer or the director. For example, some influential directors contractually negotiate for the right of final cut. Is it not possible for a composer of your international stature and reputation to insist on some level of creative control? For example, how often are you able to participate in the final mix? Morricone: This is the first time I’ve ever been asked this question. You have to remember that the director is the principal creative force in the making of the film. I have sometimes been involved in the shifting of the music from one point to another in the film—it’s good for the film and it’s good for the music, it makes the music even better. On the other hand, when a respectable director shifts the music, he does it with the musician. I’ve always worked with directors like that. And usually, because most of them were quite musical, they’ve always given me rather logical advice. Many times after I do the recording I’ll give them the sam',\n",
       "  'e kind of suggestions, that they should shift the music here or there. Since the relationship between a director and a composer is one of faith, of trust, this happens with no trauma. However, you have to remember what I said at the beginning, OK? The director is the sole author of the complete cinematic work, even if the author of the music is an important collaborator and creator, and one of the few collaborators the director is not able to control completely. Notwithstanding this, I do not believe that the director should accept a contractual clause whereby he is constrained by the composer’s decisions. Cineaste: How often has the score that you’ve written and recorded been dubbed into the picture to your satisfaction? Morricone: Almost always. What doesn’t satisfy me is that you don’t always hear the music as much as I would like. Cineaste: Dots that happen often? Morricone: Sometimes. Cineaste: Can you exercise any control over that aspect?  Morricone: I give general opinions to the directors. I tell them that a human being cannot deciph',\n",
       "  'er more than two different levels of sound at the same time—I’m not speaking of music. Physically, the brain cannot receive more than two sounds at a time. If a director mixes in the general sound column the dialog and the sound effects as well as the music, the human ear cannot distinguish the music. What one hears is a very confused kind of noise. It would be wonderful if the music had only one more element combined with it. I recommend this to the directors. Not so much for me, but for the clarity of the film, so that the public will understand it. But I can only suggest this to the director. Anything more would seem as if I were thinking only of myself and not of the film. Cineaste: How do you deal with directors, notably Gillo Pontecorvo. who have some knowledge of music and sometimes want to contribute their own themes? Morricone: With Pontecorvo, I have a good rapport. Among directors, he is one of my best friends. Therefore, when he says something I don’t like, I tell him very clearly. And I must say that he respects my opinions. Cine',\n",
       "  'aste: Do you prefer to have detailed discussions with a film’s director about the type of score he may be looking for, or would you prefer simply to be left to your own devices? Morricone: When a director calls me, he already knows what I can give him. so he recognizes in me a certain homogenity of ideas. I then have to reflect freely on the project so that I can make some proposals to him. After I’ve made my proposals, we have a discussion. He can then add his ideas, or correct mine, and that’s where the discussion takes place. Sometimes our discussion ends right away, because we agree immediately. Sometimes I have to convince the director that 1 don’t like his idea, or he has to convince me that he doesn’t like my idea, and sometimes we find a compromise. Cineaste: For most films, does an audience need a melody to hear and retain? And, if so, does that limit your creative choices? Morricone: When it is necessary, it is good to have a melodic theme. But when do we do them? This is the problem. The public and many times even the director dema',\n",
       "  'nd a melody, especially when there are some very expressive scenes that require it. This does not mean that we cannot do a film without a melody, but the public seems to expect a melodic line every time there is an expression of sentimentality. Personally, I can do without a melodic theme. In fact, in many cases I have tried to disguise the melodic theme within rests, pauses, and silence, and to encourage the public to identify those sentimental sensations with musical colors instead of a theme. Unfortunately, even though I’ve conducted many experiments along these lines, the public still wants to hear a melody. Cineaste: Why do you always orchestrate your own scores? Do you believe that composers who do not orchestrate are shortchanging either the music or the film? Morricone: I don’t want to get into delicate professional questions. However, I will make a simple declaration. Composers in all epochs and all ages, except perhaps this one, for film and other contemporary musical practices, have always written out their own music. I cannot unde',\n",
       "  'rstand why one who calls himself a composer does not finish his own music, and thereby give the final and definitive touch to his composition. This stems from the era of musical theater, where composers hired arrangers to write out the music because either they did not know how, or were too lazy, or because of the excessive workload. Throughout the history of music, no composer has had his score written out by someone else. So why does this occur in film music? I do not understand. Cineaste: Would you comment on your use of unusual sound choices—such as whistling, vocal or electronic effects—notably in the early films with Sergio Leone?  Morricone: Many believe that those were special effects. They seemed to be right, however, and therefore I put them in. After all, whistling comes out of the human body and is like the voice; it is not a special effect. In fact, it is a sound between the voice and the flute, or perhaps the piccolo. And since it comes out of the body, it is a very natural sound. I do not believe I have used any special kinds o',\n",
       "  'f instruments—except, in certain cases, the church organ, which, since nobody else had used it. was probably considered a special effect. Cineaste: You use the human voice, both solo and in choruses, far more than most composers. Why? Is it a humanizing touch for music that might otherwise seem cool? Morricone: The human voice is at the disposal of all composers. Why don’t others use it? I love the human voice, because it is an extraordinary instrument. It doesn’t go through a piece of wood or metal, it comes directly out of the body and can be the most expressive and malleable instrument. It can react in many strange ways. First, I used the human voice because I love it; and second, I used it because I had an exceptional voice at my disposal. [He alludes to Edda Dell’Orso, whose remarkable voice can be heard in several of the Leone films and other Morricone scores—ed.] And during the period we are referring to, I used that particular voice often because I really liked it. So I became known as someone who uses the human voice all the time. Pe',\n",
       "  'rhaps it’s true, but everyone can use the voice. It’s at every composer’s disposal. Cineaste: You have been known to incorporate references to classical works, including Mozart and Beethoven, in some of your scores. Is this a matter of making the music fun, either for you or for your more musically knowledgeable listeners? Morricone: I have made some very brief references at times. They are only brief references, as if for a moment you become very eccentric, but it’s not as if it was necessary or important to the piece at hand. I wanted to do it because it was fun. And I’ve always done it when I’ve composed a piece in collage form. At a certain point. I just throw in a reference—for example, a bit of Mozart—which is a minute piece of the composition. It works as a whole for the reason that the composition itself is not a homogeneous piece. Cineaste: It’s said that today you turn down more than half of the film projects offered to you. What criteria do you use in deciding which projects to accept? Morricone: If I like the director, if I have e',\n",
       "  'steem for him. that helps me to decide. And if it’s a director I’ve worked with before, and worked well with, this is a preference. I never decide after having seen a film, I decide before because professionally it’s not correct to assume a critical position to accept or refuse after having seen the work. Besides, when I see a film it’s not finished yet, so it doesn’t have all of its elements. Therefore, my refusals are really for works that I cannot do simply because I don’t have the time. Since I do all my own orchestrations—I have no help, I don’t want and have never had anybody else’s help—I have very limited time to complete work. Therefore I have to analyze my time. Cineaste: When choosing your films, is the subject matter also important, or the prospect of solving interesting dramatic problems with music? Morricone: Both of those considerations are important, but I must also explain that, for me, writing music is a very joyous experience. I love writing music and, therefore, I love this profession. More than anything, the selection is ',\n",
       "  'guided by this love to write. In addition, there is the joy of surmounting the difficulties and those requests made by the director. Tackling these requests, even though they are sometimes strange, offers the greatest satisfaction once achieved. One of the pleasures of this profession, in fact, is to address and meet the conditions set by the director. Cineaste: Once you’ve chosen a project, do you write music based on an emotional reaction to the visuals, or is it more of an intellectual exercise? Morricone: Both things, absolutely. The composer must let himself go, as a member of the public, not as a critic, and must be guided by his emotions. After this, he intervenes technically and therefore also intellectually, as well as with his artistic abilities. First, however, he must let himself go, and. then, on the wave of letting go, react to the images, and then he responds in a musically expressive manner. Cineaste: What is the average length of time you are given to write and record a film score? A common complaint among many film composers',\n",
       "  ' is that they could write better scores if they had more time. Do you agree with that or do you find the pressure of a short schedule to be a creative stimulant? Morricone: In asking the question you’ve already answered everything. Usually they give me the time I need. I never had to complain about too short a schedule because I always ask for the time I need. Cineaste: How much time is that? Morricone: Usually a month and a half, and they give it to me because they know I need it. When I didn’t have the time I needed, the score that I wrote in a very short time was not better than the one that I had four months to write. Cineaste: Was it worse? Morricone: In taking four or five months to write the music for a film, a composer could produce an excessive elaboration, an involution, in a sense, so that the result would be much less spontaneous. You have to remember that, for a film, the work has to be precise and directed toward the spectator, so too many mediations of resolution of a scientific and mathematical nature in the composition could ',\n",
       "  'be negative. With more time, then, the composer could be carried away with his taste for this elaboration and arrive at a composition that is perhaps on a slightly more superior level but one that is more difficult for the spectator. Enrico de Melis [friend of Morricone]: But there’s a very important factor you should talk about. Contrary to most other composers, directors ask you to write the scores for their films way ahead of time, when they’re writing the screenplay. Cineaste: So you’re asked very early on? Morricone: Yes, sometimes. It’s not that they ask me to write the score then, but to do the themes. I write the themes at the time the script is done. That’s not the same thing as writing a score. Cineaste: How often do you compose before seeing a final cut? Morricone: Almost always, because when I view the film it is not in its final form. Therefore, corrections to the score are usually made after the final cut has been made. Cineaste: Can you discuss the sources of your artistic inspiration, or describe the process of how you create ',\n",
       "  'such beautiful and emotionally powerful music? To avoid seeming overly mystical about this matter, and to refer to that old cliché, how much of your work derives from perspiration—that is, from hard work and years of training and experience—and how much derives from inspiration? There’s this romantic notion that the composer sits and waits for the muse to strike, after which melodies flow from his pen. But it’s actually very hard work, isn’t it? Morricone: It’s definitely a cliché. Music does not descend from the skies. I think most of it is work—sweat and application—combined with our personal influences, of the artistic experiences which have formed us, and our musical experiences, both historical ones and those particular to film. Let’s say that the general result, whether from inspiration or technical preparation, comes through many interactions between various components, and all these influences determine the final product. Cineaste: You are probably most widely known for your early scores for the Sergio Leone Westerns. Most people are ',\n",
       "  'unaware, however, that many of those scores were written before the filming was done. That’s a complete reversal of the usual production procedure. Leone said, in fact, that for those films the music was as important as the dialog.  Morricone: Leone first called me because he had heard my music for two other Italian-Spanish Westerns. He’d heard an arrangement I’d done for a song, and he wanted that arrangement for A Fistful of Dollars. It was an atmosphere to which we later added the theme, and the whistle, and so on. Then, in the following films, Leone granted a greater importance to the use of the music than most other directors. For him. music really was as important as dialog and all the other components. Therefore, he felt it was important to ask me to write the music before he shot the film. Cineaste: I’ve heard he actually filmed scenes as the music was played?  Morricone: Yes. He had a recording of an arrangement of the music which he played on the set. Cineaste: Do you find that, as with Leone. European directors are more willing tha',\n",
       "  'n American directors to let the music assume a more prominent role? Morricone: No, not at all. I do not think that Leone gave more possibilities to work within the film than other directors. It stems primarily from Leone’s style, which allowed more time, more space, for music than that of other directors. It wasn’t because of our friendship; it was strictly his particular style. For Leone, music was a very dramatic and expressive element, and, because of this, he allowed the right amount of time and space for music. If other directors do not do this, that’s OK. Again, it depends upon the personal style of the director. Cineaste: Your collaborations with Leone had an enormous impact on world cinema and on film music. Did you recognize it at the time and how do you assess their impact now? Morricone: As I said before, Leone allowed a lot more time and space for music; that was his stylistic choice. And since there was more music, people heard more music. And if they heard more music, they noticed it more. And if they noticed it more, they were ',\n",
       "  'able to assimilate it more. This is a sign that is very important to a composer, because now he finds himself collaborating on a more intense level and his music becomes an integral part of the film itself. I will make a very simple, paradoxical statement. If a director gives a composer ten seconds of time, he cannot be heard and therefore cannot collaborate with the director. However, if a director gives ten minutes of time, the composer can express himself properly. If the ten minutes that you have been given can be heard, and it is not drowned out by either the dialog between the characters or the special effects and action—which distracts the public from the music —then the music will be appreciated. However, if in those ten minutes you cannot even begin to hear any musical expression, because of the dialog or action taking place at the same time, the music is completely destroyed. Therefore, ten seconds of music, if it can be heard, is a far better collaboration between director and composer than ten minutes of music which has been stifl',\n",
       "  'ed by other factors within the film. The final decision of whether to hear the music or not remains in the hands of the director. If the director believes that the music serves a function as a dramatic and expressive form, then the music will be heard; if not, then it will not be heard. This is not a fault; we must always keep in mind Sergio Leone as the central character in this question. Cineaste: The Mission was a great favorite in this country. What was it about that film that inspired you, and can you speak about your choices, including the use of a choir and indigenous South American instruments? Morricone: I don’t know if The Mission was very well loved in America. I would have liked it if the film had been better received here. With regard to the music, there were many considerations. I was conditioned by the following things: the Jesuits, who were bringing their civilization and beliefs to South America, as well as the type of music they were accustomed to. The instruments they brought to teach to the Indians were instruments from We',\n",
       "  'stern Europe. This was the first condition. Second, one of the two protagonists played the oboe. That’s another condition. And the third condition was the music of the Indians themselves. Therefore, I had to take into account these facts, two of which were historical. The third fact was that the priest played an oboe. The oboe piece is influenced by the development and composition of Renaissance music. These were the things I had to keep in mind when writing the music for the Jesuits. There was a contrast between Renaissance music, the music created by the Indians themselves, and the oboe. These three elements, combined, gave the final result not only in a musical sense, but also in a historical sense, of the communion that existed between the Jesuits and the Indians. The result is that the music describes the spiritual union between the Jesuits and the Indians, both on a musical level—combining the styles of Western Europe, South America, and the indigenous music of the Indians—as well as on an expressive level. On a technical level, it was ',\n",
       "  'incredibly difficult. The musical concept was mine; the director did not ask me to do this. I feel very attached to this music. I recognize myself in this piece. Cineaste: How important is it, in your view, that a score for a historical film attempt to be authentic in terms of the use of original instruments or a re creation of the musical style of the era? For example, how extensive was your research for films such as Moses and Marco Polo, which involved ancient Jewish music and Oriental music. Morricone: In general, I don’t have the original instruments nor the people who can play them, and sometimes I don’t think I’m even interested in that regard. I use instruments which give the illusion of the instruments of the era, perhaps using them only for a little color, and I also use the technical composition of that period. In Marco Polo, for example. I wrote a piece with only two chords. Then there arc the Hebrew modalities, which I know well, and which are very close to the Greek ones, later acquired by the modalities of liturgical Christian ',\n",
       "  'music. Even today Gregorian chant is an emanation of the Greek and Hebrew, so all of this brought about the results of Moses and Marco Polo. Of course, in Marco Polo there was also the Chinese element, which was the result of the same idea. Cineaste: The version of Marco Polo that was shown on American television was shorter than that shown in Europe and the music seemed to be very badly mixed, even abused. Were you able to participate in the mixing of the American version of that film? Morricone: I came to Los Angeles to participate in the mixing of the music, and I was scandalized by how they treated the music. It was so…they should have been ashamed of themselves. I left before it was finished. In America they don’t care about the music on TV, all they care about is the dialog. Since they cut everything that was not dialog, they sacrificed my music in a terrible way. After that experience. I refused all TV work that would go on television in America. Cineaste: What about Abraham? Morricone: I didn’t do Abraham, I turned it down, all I did ',\n",
       "  'are the main titles and end titles. This is one of the reasons why I turned it down. I’m not against music on TV or in TV films. I am against how in America they pay attention only to dialog. It’s as if people didn’t want to lost time to hear the music. They reduced Marco Polo to a soap opera, and it’s not right. Not all TV programs are alike. A program of artistic merit, like Marco Polo, which has nothing to do with the usual commercial work, was reduced on American TV to a very low level of pure discussion between actors. It became merely a verbal account. Cineaste: Why do you think music is generally ignored in most film criticism? What for you would constitute good film music criticism?  Morricone Most film critics should not judge the music, it’s not their job, and, in general, when they do they usually come out very badly. They should talk in general about the film, its expressivity, and what the music is to the film, so that they judge the him in the totality of its elements. Sometimes a critic ventures to say that there’s too much mus',\n",
       "  'ic, or that it’s too loud, or that there’s too little music, or too much beautiful music, and when they want to talk about it they use a single adjective. That’s not criticism, really, about the music. Cineaste: Is the problem that film critics, in general, don’t have adequate musical training, and therefore the necessary critical tools, to comment authoritatively on the music? Morricone: It’s really not their job. They should judge the film in its entirety. A film is not a musical work. Cineaste: Some would argue that the sound, including the music, is sometimes as much as fifty percent of the overall cinematic experience, and that it would be a good thing if critics were able to comment more authoritatively on the music and sound. Morricone: Certainly, more attention to film music on the part of critics wouldn’t be a bad idea, it would be welcome. But you can’t ask for this. Cineaste: How important is it for you that your scores are released separately on CD? Morricone: Very important. Cineaste: Why? Morricone: Because sometimes the directo',\n",
       "  'r finds it necessary to hold back the music and so it cannot really make the contribution it would have wanted to make. In that sense, a compact disc is a way for the composer to vindicate himself, to revalidate his music. The compact disc enables the audience to finally hear the music they couldn’t hear during the film. Cineaste: Do you have any personal favorite scores? Morricone: I never answer this question, because I like all the film music that I have composed. If at the end of a him there is some thing that I didn’t really like, it is because of the use of the music in the film, or its length, or the possibility that the public won’t hear it. I have always done my best. If my goal is sometimes not achieved, then it depends on the circumstances mentioned earlier. Cineaste: Do you have any plans for concerts in the U.S.? Morricone: I don’t know. It doesn’t necessarily depend on me. Then again, what kind of concerts? If they are film music concerts. I do not want to do those. I want to do non-film music, meaning more refined, difficult mu',\n",
       "  'sic. The public wants to hear film music, but I don’t want to give it to them. So when they go to the concert, they will be disillusioned by what they hear, because they will get something they did not expect. Cineaste: How do you presently divide your time between film music and concert music? Morricone: Fifty-fifty. Cineaste: Which is more satisfying to you as a composer? Morricone: They are two separate things. You must remember that film music is written to be at the service of the cinematic work, and so is conditioned by the film. My other music is not conditioned by anything else I am the one who decides my chamber music, so 1 am the artistic father of the concert music. In the cinema, the father of the work is the director. But writing film music also gives me great satisfaction, and I’m very happy that the film music I’ve written is widely heard. To confront the director and the public and to see that the music really works in the film is a source of great satisfaction in a spiritual sense as well. Cineaste, Vol. 21, No. 1/2 (1995), p'],\n",

He reacted to movies the way somebody smart, honest and knowledgeable would respond. Most of the other critics gave us blather about the virtues and defects of a movie, and all the good it was going to do. But he re',\n",

When I began writing I cited Eastern critics (I was living on the West Coast then)—the best ones, such as Dwight Macdonald and Stanley Kauffmann—as examples of the mandarin solemnity that was sinking movie criticism. They didn’t react personally to what was on the screen; they filtered the movies through a set of ideas. I tried in most of my West Coast pieces to differentiate myself from them. People on the West Coast saw the movies then in terms of what the Eastern critics told them they should see, and often there were wonderful movies they didn’t pay attention to or rejected. Cineaste: Did you think that your emphasis on a personal voice demanded that you be as much a writer as a critic?

I felt an excitement reading Agee. Later, I also enjoyed reading Manny Farber—he’s an amazing man, and a friend—but I don’t feel a rapport with his responses to movie content. It’s his analysis of the film frame as if it were a painter’s canvas that’s a real contribution. I also read people who were critics for a brief period, or who had an unusual slant, like Cecilia Ager and Vachel Lindsay and Robert Warshow, and who sometimes did wonderful pieces on film. I was more influenced, though, by literary critics, such as R.P. Blackmur. But I think it was more my friends’ reactions and arguing with them about movies that got me interested—friends such as Robert Duncan, the poet, and another poet, Robert Horan. I had no intention of becoming a movie critic; that was a surprise. The law school at Berkeley accepted me,',\n",
       "  ' but I got involved with Horan and lost interest. I started to write, and everything snapped together in my life when I wrote about movies. The pieces I submitted were accepted immediately, whereas my articles on books and other subjects interested editors, but I was told to try them again. Still, I didn’t get a position as a movie critic until I was close to fifty. I put an awful lot of energy into crappy jobs, but I couldn’t get a job as a critic. I did a movie review program on KPFA in Berkeley. and it got a lot of attention, but I didn’t get paid. The one related job I had was running twin Berkeley movie revival theaters for five years. Cineaste: What is your opinion of academic film theory and criticism? Kael: I think much of it is useless. I don’t understand how people get so far from common sense that they make difficulties where none exist. I tried to deal with some of that when I wrote about Kracauer’s theory of film back in 1962. Contemporary theorists—feminist and deconstructivist—',\n",

It seems to me that the critic’s task should be to help people see more in the work than they might see without him. That’s a modest function, and you don’t need a big theory for it.

I gradually talked myself into it, and was happy that I did. Cineaste: Do you see the rise of independent American film as a genuine alternative to Hollywood? Kael: Does that mean that Hollywood is the Great Satan? Generally, as soon as you make a successful independent film, Hollywood releases it anyway. What matters is that the movies reach an audience. I rather like Michael Almereyda’s films, but does it matter where he got the money? You’re always borrowing your money from someone. There have been good films, like Flirting with Disaster, Chasin',\n",
       "  'g Amy,\\xa0and One False Move. I’m not sure which you would consider independent. I love Vanya on 42nd Street. It was certainly a small production. But I also loved the MGM musical Pennies From Heaven, and I preferred Last of the Mohicans to Safe.  Cineaste: You have usually critically excoriated “middlebrow”\\xa0films like Chariots of Fire and liberal, well-meaning films like Coming Home. How did your New Yorker readers respond to those critiques? Kael: The angriest mail I got was from disliking Rain Man, because people felt I was somehow putting down autism. It’s the same problem I had when I said that Shoah was not a masterwork. They think you’re being insensitive about the Holocaust, even though they themselves may have seen the movie in a blind torpor of tears and suffering. There’s often a confusion in the audience’s mind between a movie’s message and the quality of the movie. Liberal moviegoers are so sweet on themselves, and liberal movies flatter them. I tried to make distinctions. For examp',\n",
       "  'le, in Coming Home, the right-wing military officer was lousy in bed, and the mutilated boy wasn’t just a liberal fellow—he was also great in bed. It’s as if the liberals want to congratulate themselves in every possible way. The plot of a film like that is offensively convenient. It violates what you know about the world. The Front never came close to what we saw in the press, which was that the blacklisted writers looked like Woody Allen and the men who fronted for them looked handsome and distinguished. In the movie they reversed it. All I ask for is a little tough-mindedness. Can’t educated liberals see that a movie like American Beauty sucks up to them at every plot turn? Cineaste: If you dislike films that project a facile, sentimentally liberal perspective, what is your critical response to two genuinely left, sometimes politically heavy directors whom Cine\\xadaste often interviews —Ken Loach and John Sayles? Kael: I agree that they’re not facile, but their political content is heavy only',\n",
       "  ' in the sense of being often oppressive. Loach is no bundle of joy, and Sayles is a literal\\xad-minded director. His work is decent, intelligent, and filled with integrity, hut he doesn’t have a real instinct for making movies. There are kids who make movies when they’re twenty-five, who know nothing about anything else, but who have a flair for the medium. He doesn’t. But to go back: I didn’t dislike American Beauty—I hated it. It’s not that it’s badly made—it isn’t. It has snappy rhythms and Kevin Spacey’s line readings are very smart, and Annette Bening is skillful in the scene where she beats up on herself. But the picture is a con. It buries us under the same load of attitudes that were tried out in Car\\xadnal Knowledge and The Ice Storm, with the nice trustworthy young dope-dealers of Easy Rider. Maybe audiences are so familiar with this set of anti-suburbia attitudes that it’s developed into its own movie genre. Cineaste: Did you allow your political sympathies to intrude when dealing with r',\n",
       "  'ight-wing films like Don Siegel’s Dirty Harry? Kael: I don’t know what you mean by “intrude.” The movie was popular with people partly because of its right-wing attitude, but they didn’t necessarily recognize it as right wing. Certainly most of the press didn’t, not when it first came out. I felt it necessary to treat it as a political work because its politics offended me. Eastwood’s films are right wing in a way that doesn’t get analyzed because they’re not explicitly so. I’m amazed at the number of critics who let his attitudes slide right by them. Cineaste: If you’re critical of the Eastwood films, why is Peckinpah such a favorite? Kael: I never said he was a good person. But he had a true gift as a moviemaker. I try to look at the quality of the work. That includes the quality of the perceptions. Cineaste: Was Peckinpah’s machismo more posture than reality? Kael: Yes. but he lived the posture.

And I wouldn’t leave out The Long Goodbye, Thieves Like Us, or Vincent and Theo. I met Cassavetes one evening on the West Coast just as I was coming East in the mid-Sixties. It’s very’ strange that Cassavetes, who is identified with new directions in movies, had so little knowledge of movie history; he didn’t know the experimental work of the Twenties and Thirties—I was flabbergasted to learn he had never heard of\\xa0Un chien andalou. There was a naive streak in a lot of what he did. I liked Shadows, but felt that he got into a trap with the films he made with Ben Gazzara and Peter Falk. I felt those movies were tediously overwrought and that he—out of love, no doubt—did the wrong things with Gena Rowlands, who had been wonderful in her pre-Cassavetes work. I felt she was acting all the time in Cassavetes’s movies; she nev',\n",
       "  'er relaxed. It drove me crazy. I don’t fully understand why so many students and young directors made an idol of Cassavetes. But I could see that they were deeply affected by those movies in which men sit around joshing each other and being pig\\xadgish. Cineaste: Few film critics have your capacity to capture the quality of an actor’s performance. Kael: I think so much of what we respond to in fictional movies is acting. That’s one of the elements that’s often left out when people talk theoretically about movies. They forget it’s the human material we go to see. A movie without actors is not, generally, a very compelling or memorable movie. There are great documentarians, of course, and directors who can make movies where we’re fascinated by the whole look and feel of things, but generally we need an actor, or a group of actors, to involve us emotionally. Or just to pep things up—the way Christopher Plummer peps up The Insider. Or the way Mike Nichols brings something dazzling and original to Th',\n",
       "  'e Designated Mourner. Or, to look back, the way that Debra Winger could be piercing. Movies give us presents: people like Judy Davis, a wizard at conveying neurosis and making it witty. They give us the sheer charm of Drew Barrymore. Cineaste: A film critic has written that Pauline Kael seems the most “unself doubting person I’ve ever met.” Given that you write your pieces after only a single viewing, has your self-confidence as a critic ever faltered? Kael: I’m not a very insecure person. Maybe that has something to do with my having been the youngest in a large family. I was funny, so they liked me and always encouraged me to talk. Would you rather I studied a movie? I feel I get the movie on the first viewing more completely than I would get it if I labored over it. I like it best on the first viewing because it’s got suspense and excitement. This is a personal thing that I should probably never have told people about. I come from a generation that saw movies once. When 16mm projectors and',\n",
       "  ' film societies started to be popular, and, more recently, when movielovers got videos, they began to poke over the movies endlessly. I think that violates people’s first reactions; they become scholars of movies instead of people who respond to what they see. I don’t know why it would make those scholars feel better if I said I watched a picture five times. Cineaste: If you don’t doubt your perceptions, did you ever doubt your talent? Kael: I doubted my talent when I first tried to write. I was very pedestrian at first because I’d had a lot of university, and was a very good student. You learn to be pedestrian—to footnote everything and do all those damned things that they teach you to do at college that turn you into a bore. I doubted that I could ever loosen up enough as a writer, but I found I loosened up when I wrote about movies. Cineaste: Did being a woman present an obstacle to your career? Kael: I never thought of it as a career. It was more like a folly. Well, women then were gutsie',\n",
       "  'r than contemporary women think they were. And maybe I didn’t think about obstacles because I never felt any pressure in the family to be any less than the boys. It never scared me to be one of the few women critics in a male world. I found that many of the male critics could be quite stupid. But more often they were just scared people who wanted to be in the swing of things, and tried to please their editors and the advertisers. They were gutless, and they’re still gutless. On the other hand, a lot of them lost their jobs by panning movies that had heavy advertising budgets. Cineaste: Some critics have asserted that your real genius is sociological, and that you are antagonistic to the European art film. Kael: That’s a hostile question, especially with the sly “your real genius.” Have you read me on Gillo Pontecorvo or Francesco Rosi? Have you read me on Bertolucci’s 1900 or Truffaut’s Story of Adele H. or Visconti’s The Leopard or Tanner’s Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000 or Bellocchio',\n",
       "  '’s China Is Near and Leap Into the Void? Or do you think I should have written more about the draggy ones? I know there are people who fell in love with the high-art qualities of movies, but I can’t fully account for that phenomenon. I understand that some people dismiss me as “the ultimate democrat” because I like a lot of popular movies. But popular movies got me involved in movies in the first place, so why deny them now? Many of us love the actors, the excitement, the trashiness, the pure pleasure, without feeling we need to justify that pleasure. Cineaste: Still, given your critical sympathy for the sexual energy and kineticism of films, isn’t there some implicit antipathy towards art films directed by people like Dreyer and Bresson? Kael: You’ve got the wrong people for me to be antipathetic towards. I’m not generally drawn to the directors who make spiritual movies that seem to occur in slow motion, such as Ozu and Tarkovsky. But I loved Dreyer’s Passion of Joan of Arc and Day of Wrath',\n",
       "  '. As he got older, I didn’t respond to his movies in the same way. They simply weren’t for me. Bresson is the only director who made a film (Diary of a Country Priest) that put me to sleep twice. I don’t understand why, since I think it’s a great movie; I admired it while I was dozing. Cineaste:: What about Godard? Kael: Oh, I loved writing about films like La Chinoise, Masculine/Feminine and Weekend. I was hired at The New Yorker partly because of a piece I wrote on Godard in The New Republic. William Shawn read it, and, having admired some of Godard’s movies, talked to me about coming to The New Yorker. Cineaste: The Seventies were arguably the most creative decade in American film. What is your opinion of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, Peter Biskind’s account of Seventies Hollywood? Kael: It’s a piece of semifictional fantasy. He puts me, for instance, in the middle of situations that I don’t know anything about. And I’ve heard from other people that he treated them similarly. But it’s his app',\n",
       "  'roach that’s really sickening. Here’s this great, heroic era in American films, when people were struggling against all sorts of forces to get their visions onto the screen, and they achieved it. It’s the greatest period in our movies. Films like Nashville, and The Godfather I and II, The Landlord, Shampoo, Mean Streets, McCabe and Mrs. Miller—dozens of great films, or at least amazing ones—were made. And all Biskind does is try to make everybody look like a backstabbing egomaniac. However they may have misbehaved, those people had to have some commitment to the art of movies to do what they did. He’s using our knowledge of how great that period was as a come-on to read about how swinish the people were. Cineaste: Would you say that the Seventies directors were able to harness their self-destructiveness into creative work? Kael: Their self-destructiveness sometimes worked against them. Ashby died young, and some of the others never did as great work again. Directors such as Wyler and Hitchcoc',\n",
       "  'k who lasted for decades had a studio system supporting them. These guys had to pull it all out of themselves. It’s miraculous, really, what they did. When you go to a movie now, it doesn’t give you the tensions in how people live now in the way their movies did. Cineaste: What has happened to Coppola’s career since the Seventies? Kael: I think people sometimes burn themselves out, particularly in making movies. He’s done some respectable work since then. Some of his pictures have promising conceptions, such as Peggy Sue Got Married and Tucker and Gardens of Stone, but he doesn’t fully realize them. He seems content just to put on a show. Still, if you have three or four great films to your credit, you shouldn’t be called a failure. An author who cared about movies would be obsessed with what a director like Coppola put into his movies—not what (in Biskind’s fancy) burned him out. Cineaste: You have written that you find films “a supremely pleasurable art form.” Are there any contemporary mov',\n",
       "  'ies that provide that kind of emotional and esthetic charge? Kael: No, they don’t offer that richness. The Seventies movies meant so much to young people. They argued, thought about, and were really upset by them. Movies affected audiences in so many ways. The kids who said “Wow!” when they came out of a movie and couldn’t say any more were expressing some deep feeling. The kids who come out of Twister may say “Wow!” but it isn’t the same “Wow!” It’s a special-effects “Wow!” This doesn’t mean that movies are finished; it means they’re changing. Cineaste: In your critique of Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, you wrote that Kubrick is “a clean-minded pornographer that the film’s sex “has no sensuality,”\\xa0and its characters are “frigidly, pedantically calculated.” Isn’t much of that critique also applicable to Eyes Wide Shut? Kael: Yes, the two movies have a spirit in common. The big difference is that A Clockwork Orange got to audiences. It works. While Eyes Wide Shut is a lousy movie. A Clockwork O',\n",
       "  'range is lousy in its attitudes and its thinking. Sometimes I hate a movie more when it works. The thuggishness of Clockwork is comparable to that of some of the Nazi films that worked. Eyes Wide Shut can be ignored. Scene by scene it’s a howl. Cineaste: You’ve written that in E.T., “Spielberg is like a boy soprano lilting with joy.” What’s your opinion of his ostensibly more morally and socially serious work? Kael: He’s gone to the pulpit. Everything has gone flat in his directing. He had such flair in Jaws, and his early movies. He seemed so sophisticated and intelligent—so sharp about what he was doing. There’s still a little bit of joy in the Indiana Jones trilogy. But now there’s a real simpleton’s morality that he hands the audience, like when you hear him on television saying that everyone should be forced to see Schindler’s List. Soon he and Benigni, director of Life is Beautiful, will be working up a doubles act. Cineaste: As a critic, were your relations with directors ever problema',\n",
       "  'tic? Kael: No one enjoys being panned, but what are you suggesting? That my relations with directors were improper? I don’t think they were. How can you be involved in an art form and not know some of the artists? The important thing is to be honest about your responses to their work and not to profiteer off knowing them. Directors or actors do often say horrible things about a critic in print or on TV and then they may take the critic aside and try to square themselves. They may write you a little private apology—the apology is always private. Cineaste: Am I right that stylistically you prefer films that are looser, more improvisational and intuitive than those that are more calibrated? Kael: In general. But some calibrated movies work wonderfully. De Palma is not an improvisational director, and he’s made several movies, such as Casualties of War, that are as good as anything done in this country in the last decades. Some of his very early films were improvisational. Hi, Mom!, for one, is w',\n",

I mind the overly controlled film, one too bound by a classic structure. I like movies to have a little looseness and bounce. Cineaste: Are you particularly susceptible to films that estheticize kitsch—movies like Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in America—that are vivid and vital despite having a second-rate script? Kael: Are you trying to nail me for something? I don’t understand what. The Sergio Leone film was kitsch alright—lyric kitsch; its image of Lower East Side immigrant life is absurd. Leone’s father worked in movies, and the boy literally grew up in the studio. All his movies are dream-plays. They derive from movies, and he didn’t seem to have any experience outside of movies and studio life. So his movies are visions sustained from childhood of Hollywood’s version of America. Cineaste: Do you feel that some of the younger American directors have been sh',\n",
       "  'aped by movies and nothing more? Kael: They sometimes make a smashing beginning and you think they’re going to have a great career, but they lack the experience, the point of view, and the taste. They haven’t read enough or seen enough of the other arts to grow as moviemakers. Movies by themselves are not enough of an education. Leone breathed a kind of visionary poetry into his epics, but most of the American film-school kids have a hard time projecting a strong enough vision to make their movies cohere. Then there are the very young kids who only seem to know hand-me-downs from Tarantino. Cineaste: You’ve also written about the special “aphrodisia” of films. Would you expand on what you mean? Kael: When we first begin seeing movies they have an erotic quality. It’s one of the first attractions that kids feel for them. Part of the appeal of movies is the sensuality of the actors and actresses—their faces give us pleasure. The symmetry of their beauty is often very appealing. They’re more bea',\n",
       "  'utiful than the people we see in life, and they give us standards of beauty and feeling. Their emotions transform us. Someone like Garbo opened up a generation of moviegoers to a kind of sensuality they didn’t experience elsewhere. There’s something about a great actress on screen that can be extraordinary. Garbo had something else plus beauty. When you watch her in the scene in A Woman of Affairs, where she inhales a bouquet of roses, you think you’ve never seen anyone inhale so completely. It’s not comparable to what goes on on the stage. The closeness of the people and the darkness of the movie theater and the private quality of our emotions make us relate to the actors in a special way. I think people make a huge mistake when they become interested in film and don’t give the actors and actresses more consideration. The popular audience reacts to a movie as a work with so-and-so. That really is the basis of our wanting to see more movies. That’s still the case. There’s nothing comparable t',\n",
       "  'o the pleasure people get from soaking in beauty. Teenagers certainly go to movies to look at Leonardo di Caprio, Keanu Reeves, and Brendan Fraser. Girls and boys want to look at Rachel Weisz, Jenna Elfman, Jennifer Lopez, and Gina Gershon, with her lovely warped smile—ideal for villainy. Even the special effects in The Matrix had a poetic quality—I don’t think people were going to see that film for the story. There’s something about watching Sigourney Weaver in Galaxy Quest that’s like nothing else. It’s fun watching big, strong women strutting their stuff. It’s fun seeing talent reveal itself—I’m thinking of Amanda Plummer and Madeleine Stowe and Fairuza Balk. Cineaste: Do you have regrets about pieces you have written, and, more importantly, about retiring? Kael: I have regrets about retiring, and some of them have to do with extraordinary movies that I would have loved to review. I still love going to movies, and I feel a pang, sometimes, that I could have pointed out to readers some good',\n",

Chris Marker’s The Last Bolshevik is a great film that almost no one has seen. Run Lola Run I’d have enjoyed reviewing. Being John Malkovich kept me on my toes for about twenty minutes, but by the time it was over I felt no desire to write about it. In any case, I no longer have the words; I hesitate. I loved writing about movies and I miss it, of course. But look: I was lucky, I lived in the century of pop. Or let me put it this way: culture without pop, to quote a phrase from McCabe “freezes my soul.” That’s why I’m not so keen on Loach and Sayles. David O. Russell’s political farce Three Kings is much more to my taste. I like the mixture of tones— Gunga Din and something of what Richard Lester was trying for in How I Won the War.
