## Overview:
#### Welcome to the Interview Analysis and Text Generation project! In this data science project, we explore a dataset containing interviewers' transcripts and their corresponding interviews. We will perform various data processing and analysis techniques to gain insights into the interviews and the sentiments expressed. Additionally, we will use topic modeling techniques to discover underlying themes in the interviews. Finally, we'll leverage natural language processing to generate new text based on the interview content.
